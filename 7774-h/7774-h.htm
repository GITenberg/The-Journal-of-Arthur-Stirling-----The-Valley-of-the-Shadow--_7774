      EDITOR'S INTRODUCTION
    </h2>
    <p>
      The matter which is given to the public in this book will speak with a
      voice of its own; it is necessary, however, to say a few words in advance
      to inform the reader of its history.
    </p>
    <p>
      The writer of the journal herein contained was not known, I believe, to
      more than a dozen people in this huge city in which he lived. I am quite
      certain that I and my wife were the only persons he ever called his
      friends. I met him shortly after his graduation from college, and for the
      past few years I knew, and I alone, of a life of artistic devotion of such
      passionate fervor as I expect never to meet with again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arthur Stirling was entirely a self-educated man; he had worked at I know
      not how many impossible occupations, and labored in the night-time like
      the heroes one reads about. He taught himself to read five languages, and
      at the time when I saw him last he knew more great poetry by heart than
      any man of letters that I have ever met. He was the author of one book, a
      tragedy in blank verse, called The Captive; that drama forms the chief
      theme of this journal. For the rest, it seems to me enough to quote this
      notice, which appeared in the New York Times for June 9, 1902.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  STIRLING.&mdash;By suicide in the Hudson River, poet and
     man of genius, in the 22d year of his age, only son of
     Richard T. and Grace Stirling, deceased, of Chicago.
       Chicago papers please copy.
</pre>
    <p>
      Arthur Stirling was in appearance a tall, dark-haired boy&mdash;he was
      really only a boy&mdash;with a singularly beautiful face, and a strange
      wistful expression of the eyes that I think will haunt me as long as I
      live. I made him, somewhat externally and feebly, I fear, one of the
      characters in a recently published novel. That he was a lonely spirit will
      be plain enough from his writings; he lived among the poverty-haunted
      thousands of this city, without (so he once told me) ever speaking to a
      living soul for a week. Pecuniarily I could not help him&mdash;for though
      he was poor, I was scarcely less so. At the time of his frightful death I
      had not seen him for nearly two months&mdash;owing to circumstances which
      were in no way my fault, but for which I can nevertheless not forgive
      myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The writing of The Captive, as described in these papers, was begun in
      April, 1901. I was myself at that time in the midst of a struggle to have
      a book published. It was not really published until late in that year&mdash;at
      which time The Captive was finished and already several times rejected. It
      was an understood thing between us that should my book succeed it would
      mean freedom for both of us, but that, unfortunately, was not to be.
    </p>
    <p>
      Early in April of 1902 I had succeeded in laying by provisions enough to
      last me while I wrote another book, and I fled away to put up my tent in
      the wilderness. The last time that I ever saw Arthur Stirling was in his
      room the night before I left. He smiled very bravely and said that he
      would keep his courage up, that he was pretty sure he would come out all
      right.
    </p>
    <p>
      I did not expect him to write often&mdash;I knew that he was too poor for
      that; but after six weeks had passed and I had not heard from him at all,
      I wrote to a friend to go and see him. It developed that he had moved. The
      lodging-house keeper could only say that he had left her his baggage,
      being unable to pay his rent; and that he &ldquo;looked sick.&rdquo; Where he went she
      did not know, and all efforts of mine to find him were of no avail. The
      only person that I knew of to ask was a certain young girl, a typewriter,
      who had known him for years, and who had worshiped him with a strange and
      terrible passion&mdash;who would have been his wife, or his slave, if he
      had not been as iron in such things, a man so lost in his vision that I
      suppose he always thought she was lost in it too. This girl had copied his
      manuscripts for years, with the plea that he might pay her when he
      &ldquo;succeeded&rdquo;; and she has all of his manuscripts now, except what I have,
      if she is alive. All that we could learn was that she had &ldquo;gone away&rdquo;; I
      feel pretty certain that she went in search of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition, all that I have to tell is that on Monday, June 9th last I
      received a large express package from Arthur. It was sent from New York,
      but marked as coming from another person&mdash;evidently to avoid giving
      an address of his own. Upon opening it I found two packages, one of them
      carefully sealed and marked upon the outside, The Captive; the other was
      the manuscript of this journal, and upon the top of it was the following
      letter:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    MY DEAR &mdash;&mdash;: You have no doubt been wondering what has become
    of me. I have been having a hard time of it. I wish I could
    find some way to make this thing a little easier, but I can
    not. When you read this letter I shall be dead. There is
    nothing that I can tell you about it that you will not read in
    the papers I send you. It is simply that I was born to be an
    artist, and that as anything else I can not live. The burden
    that has been laid upon me I can not bear another day. I have
    told the whole story of it in this book&mdash;I have kept myself
    alive for months, sick and weeping with agony, in order that I
    might tear it out of my heart and get it written. It has been
    my last prayer that the struggle my life has been may somehow
    not be useless. There will come others after me&mdash;others perhaps
    keener than I&mdash;and oh, the world must not kill them all!

    You will take this manuscript, please, and go over it, and cut
    out what you like to make it printable, and write a few words
    to make people understand about it. And then see if any one
    will publish it. You know more about all these things than I
    do. If it should sell, keep part of the money for your own
    work and give the rest to poor Ellen. As to The Captive&mdash;I
    all but burned it, as you will read; but keep it, sealed as
    I have sealed it, for two years, and then offer it to some
    publishers&mdash;to others than the nine who have already rejected
    it. If you can not find any one to take it, then burn it, or
    keep it for love, I do not care which.

    I am writing this on Thursday night, and I am almost dead. I
    mean to get some money to-morrow, and then to buy a ticket for
    as far up the Hudson as I can go. In the evening I mean to find
    a steep bank, and, with a heavy dumb-bell I have bought, and
    a strong rope, I think I can find the peace that I have been
    seeking.

    The first thing that I have to say to you about it is, that
    when you get this letter it will be over and done, and that I
    want you, for God's sake, not to make any fuss. No one will
    find my body and no one will care about it. You need not think
    it necessary to notify the newspapers&mdash;what I'm sending you
    here is literature and not journalism. I have no earthly
    belongings left except these MSS., upon which you will have to
    pay the toll. I have written to M&mdash;&mdash;, a man who once did some
    typewriting for me, asking him to use a dollar he owes me in
    putting a notice in one of the papers. I suppose I owe that to
    the people out West.

    I can't write you to-night&mdash;before God I can't; my head is going
    like a steel-mill, and I'm <i>so</i> sick. You will get over
    this somehow, and go on and do your task and win. And if the
    memory of my prayer can help you, that will be something. Do
    the work of both of us if you can. Only, if you do pull through,
    remember my last cry&mdash;remember the young artist! There is no
    other fight so worth fighting&mdash;take it upon you&mdash;shout it day
    and night at them&mdash;what things they do with their young artists!

    God bless you, dear friend. Yours, ARTHUR.
</pre>
    <p>
      The above is the only tidings of him, excepting the extended accounts of
      his death which appeared in the New York Times and the New York World for
      June 10 and 11, 1902, and several letters which he wrote to other people.
      There remains only to say a few words as to the journal.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is scrawled upon old note-books and loose sheets of paper. The matter,
      although a diary, contains odd bits of his writings&mdash;one of two
      letters to me which he had me send back, and some extracts from an essay
      which a friend of mine was offering at that time to magazines in the hope
      of placing it for him. There is a problem about the work which I leave to
      others to solve&mdash;how much of it was written as dated, and how much
      afterward, as a piece of art, as a testament of his sorrow. Parts of it
      have struck me as having been composed in the latter way, and the last
      pages, of course, imply as much.
    </p>
    <p>
      Extraordinary pages they are to me. That a man who was about to take his
      life should have written them is one of the strangest cases of artistic
      absorption I know of in literature. But Arthur Stirling was a man lost in
      his art just so&mdash;so full of it, so drunk with it, that nothing in
      life had other meaning to him. To quote the words he loved, from the last
      of his heroes, he longed for excellence &ldquo;as the lion longs for his food.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So he lived and so he worked; the world had no use for his work, and so he
      died.

      READER:
    </h2>
    <p>
      I do not know if &ldquo;The Valley of the Shadow&rdquo; means to you what it means to
      me; I do not know if it means anything at all to you. But I have sought
      long and far for these words, to utter an all but unutterable thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you walk in the forest you do not count the lives that you tread into
      nothingness. When you rejoice with the springtime you do not hear the
      cries of the young things that are choked and beaten down and dying. When
      you watch the wild thing in your snare you do not know the meaning of the
      torn limbs, and the throbbing heart, and the awful silence of the creature
      trapped. When you go where the poor live, and see thin faces and hungry
      eyes and crouching limbs, you do not think of these things either.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I, reader&mdash;I dwell in the Valley of the Shadow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes it is silent in my Valley, and the creatures sit in terror of
      their own voices; sometimes there are screams that pierce the sky; but
      there is never any answer in my Valley. There are quivering hands there,
      and racked limbs, and aching hearts, and panting souls. There is gasping
      struggle, glaring failure&mdash;maniac despair. For over my Valley rolls
      <i>The Shadow</i>, a giant thing, moving with the weight of mountains. And
      you stare at it, you feel it; you scream, you pray, you weep; you hold up
      your hands to your God, you grow mad; but the Shadow moves like Time, like
      the sun, and the planets in the sky. It rolls over you, and it rolls on;
      and then you cry out no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is that way in my Valley. The Shadow is the Shadow of Death.

    <h3>
      WRITING A POEM
    </h3>
    <p>
      The book! The book! This day, Saturday, the sixth day of April, 1901, I
      begin the book!
    </p>
    <p>
      I have never kept a journal&mdash;I have been too busy living; but to-day
      I begin a journal. I am so built that I can do but one thing at a time.
      Now that I have begun The Captive, I must be haunted with it all day; when
      I am not writing it I must be dreaming it, or restless because I am not.
      Therefore it occurred to me that in the hours of weariness I would write
      about it what was in my mind&mdash;what fears and what hopes; why and how
      I write it will be a story in itself, and some day I think it will be
      read.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      I have come to the last stage of the fight, and I see the goal. I will
      tell the story, and by and by wise editors can print it in the Appendix!
    </p>
    <p>
      Yesterday I was a cable-car conductor, and to-day I am a poet!
    </p>
    <p>
      I know of some immortal poems that were written by a druggist's clerk, and
      some by a gager of liquid barrels, but none by a cable-car conductor. &ldquo;It
      sounds interesting, tell us about it!&rdquo; says the reader. I shall, but not
      to-day.
    </p>
    <p>
      To-day I begin the book!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      I did not write that on April 6th, I wrote it a month ago&mdash;one day
      when I was thinking about this. I put it there now, because it will do to
      begin; but I had no jests in my heart on April 6th.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      April 10th.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have been for four days in a kind of frenzy. I have come down like a
      collapsed balloon, and I think I have had enough for once.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have written the opening scene, but not finally; and then I got into the
      middle&mdash;I could not help it. How in God's name I am ever to do this
      fearful thing, I don't know; it frightens me, and sometimes I lose all
      heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      I suppose I shall have to begin again tonight. I must eat something first,
      though. That is one of my handicaps: I wear myself out and have to stop
      and eat. Will anybody ever love me for this work, will anybody ever
      understand it?
    </p>
    <p>
      I suppose I can get back where I was yesterday, but always it grows
      harder, and more stern. I set my teeth together.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      It was like the bursting of an overstrained dam, these last four days. How
      long I have been pent up&mdash;eighteen months! And eighteen months seems
      like a lifetime to me. I have been a bloodhound in the leash, hungering&mdash;hungering
      for this thing, and the longing has piled up in me day by day. Sometimes
      it has been more than I could bear; and when the time was near, I was so
      wild that I was sick. The book! The book! Freedom and the book!
    </p>
    <p>
      And last Saturday I went out of the hell-house where I have been pent so
      long, and I covered my face with my hands and fled away home&mdash;away to
      the little corner that is mine. There I flung myself down and sobbed like
      a child. It was relief&mdash;it was joy&mdash;it was fear! It was
      everything! The book! The book! Then I got up&mdash;and the world seemed
      to go behind me, and I was drunk. I heard a voice calling&mdash;it
      thundered in my ears&mdash;that I was free&mdash;that my hour was come&mdash;that
      I might live&mdash;that I might live&mdash;live! And I could have shouted
      it&mdash;I know that I laughed it aloud. Every time I thought the thought
      it was like the throbbing of wings to me&mdash;&ldquo;Free! Free!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No one can understand this&mdash;no one who has not a demon in his soul.
      No one who does not know how I have been choked&mdash;what horrors I have
      borne.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am through with that&mdash;I did not think of that. I am free! They will
      never have me back.
    </p>
    <p>
      That motive alone would drive me to my work, would make me dare <i>anything</i>.
      But I do not need that motive.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>

      I think only of the book. I thought of it last Saturday, and it swept me
      away out of myself. I had planned the opening scene; but then the thought
      of the triumph-song took hold of me, and it drove me mad. That song was
      what I had thought I could never do&mdash;I had never dared to think of
      it. And it came to me&mdash;it came! Wild, incoherent, overwhelming, it
      came, the victorious hymn. I could not think of remembering it; it was not
      poetry&mdash;it was reality. <i>I</i> was the Captive, <i>I</i> had won
      freedom&mdash;a faith and a vision!
    </p>
    <p>
      So it throbbed on and on, and I was choked, and my head on fire, and my
      hands tingling, until I sank down from sheer exhaustion&mdash;laughing and
      sobbing, and talking to God as if He were in the room. I never really
      believe in God except at such times; I can go through this dreadful world
      for months, and never think if there be a God.&mdash;Here I sit gossiping
      about it.&mdash;But I am tired out.

      The writing of a book is like the bearing of a child. But every birth-pang
      of the former lasts for hours; and it is months before the labor is done.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not merely the vision, the hour of exultation; that is but the
      setting of the task. Now you will take that ecstasy, and hold on to it,
      hold on with soul and body; you will keep yourself at that height, you
      will hold that flaming glory before your eyes, and you will hammer it into
      words. Yes, that is the terror&mdash;into words&mdash;into words that leap
      the hilltops, that bring the ends of existence together in a lightning
      flash. You will take them as they come, white-hot, in wild tumult, and you
      will forge them, and force them. You will seize them in your naked hands
      and wrestle with them, and bend them to your will&mdash;all that is the
      making of a poem. And last and worst of all, you will hold them in your
      memory, the long, long surge of them; the torrent of whirling thought&mdash;you
      will hold it in your memory! You are dazed with excitement, exhausted with
      your toil, trembling with pain; but you have built a tower out of cards,
      and you have mounted to the clouds upon it, and there you are poised. And
      anything that happens&mdash;anything!&mdash;Ah, God, why can the poet not
      escape from his senses?&mdash;a sound, a touch&mdash;and it is gone!
    </p>
    <p>
      These things drive you mad.&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      But meanwhile it is not gone yet. You have still a whole scene in your
      consciousness&mdash;as if you were a juggler, tossing a score of golden
      balls. And all the time, while you work, you learn it&mdash;you learn it!
      It is endless, but you learn it. In the midst of it, perhaps, you come
      down of sheer exhaustion; and you lie there, panting, shuddering, your
      hands moist; you dare not think, you wait. And then by and by you begin
      again&mdash;if it will not come, you <i>make</i> it come, you lash
      yourself like a dumb beast&mdash;up, up, to the mountain-tops again. And
      then once more the thing comes back&mdash;you live the scene again, as an
      actor does, and you shape it and you master it. And now in the midst of
      it, you find this highest of all moments is gone! It is gone, and you can
      not find it! Those words that came as a trumpet-clash, burning your very
      flesh&mdash;that melody that melted your whole being to tears&mdash;they
      are gone&mdash;you can not find them! You search and you search&mdash;but
      you can not find them. And so you stumble on, in despair and agony; and
      still you dare not rest. You dare not ever rest in this until the thing is
      done&mdash;done and over&mdash;until you have <i>nailed</i> it fast. So
      you go back again, though perhaps you are so tired that you are fainting;
      but you fight yourself like a madman, you struggle until you feel a thing
      at your heart like a wild beast; and you keep on, you hold it fast and
      learn it, clinch it tight, and make it yours forever. I have done that
      same thing five times to-day without a rest; and toiled for five hours in
      that frenzy; and then lain down upon the ground, with my head on fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      Afterward when you have recovered you sit down, and for two or three hours
      you write; you have it whole in your memory now&mdash;you have but to put
      it down. And this forlorn, wet, bedraggled thing&mdash;this miserable,
      stammering, cringing thing&mdash;<i>this</i> is your poem!

      I wrote this, and then I leaned back, tired out. My thoughts turned to
      Shakespeare, and while I was thinking of him&mdash;

    </p>
    <p>
      I have not done much to-day. I spent the morning brooding over the opening
      speech. It is somber and terrible, but I have not gotten it right. It must
      have a tread&mdash;a tread like an orchestra! Ah, how I wish I had an
      orchestra!&mdash;I would soon do it then&mdash;<i>&ldquo;So bist nun ewig du
      verdammt!&rdquo;</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      The secret of the thing is iteration. I must find a word that is like a
      hammer-stroke. I have tried twenty, but I have not found the one.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      &mdash;I spent the rest of the day thinking over the whole first act,
      mapping it out, so to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have often fancied a resemblance between The Captive and the C-minor
      symphony; I wonder if any one else would have thought of it. It is not
      merely the opening&mdash;it is the whole content of the thing&mdash;the
      struggle of a prisoned spirit. I would call The Captive a symphony, and
      print the C-minor themes in it, only it would seem fanciful.&mdash;But it
      would not really be fanciful to put the second theme opposite the thought
      of freedom&mdash;of the blue sky and the dawning spring.
    </p>
    <p>
      All except the scherzo. I couldn't find room for the scherzo. Men who have
      wrestled with the demons of hell do not tumble around like elephants, no
      matter how happy they are. I wish I could take out Beethoven's scherzos!
    </p>
    <p>
      My heart leaps when I think of my one big step. I have put those pages
      away&mdash;I shall not look at them again for a month. Then I can judge
      them.

    <p>
      A cable-car conductor and a poet! I think that will be a story worth
      telling.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have tried many and various occupations, but I have not found one so
      favorable to the study of poetry as my last. I should have made out very
      well&mdash;if I had not been haunted by The Captive.
    </p>
    <p>
      With everything else you do you are more or less hampered by having to
      sell your brain; and also by having to obey some one. But a cable-car is
      an unlimited monarchy; and all you have to do is to collect fares and pull
      the bell, both of which duties are quite mechanical. And besides that you
      receive princely wages&mdash;and can live off one-third of them, if you
      know how; and that means that you need only work one-third of the time,
      and can write your poetry the rest of it!
    </p>
    <p>
      This sounds like jesting, but it is not. I have only been a cable-car
      conductor six months, but in that time I have taught myself to read Greek
      with more than fluency. All you need is good health and spirits, a will of
      iron, and a very tiny note-book in the palm of your hand, full of the
      words you wish to learn. And then for ten or twelve hours a day you go
      about running a car with your body&mdash;and with your mind&mdash;hammering,
      hammering! It is excellent discipline&mdash;it is fighting all day, &ldquo;<i>Pous,
      podos</i>, the foot&mdash;<i>pous, podos</i>, the foot&mdash;34th Street,
      Crosstown East and West&mdash;<i>pous, podos</i>, the foot!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And then when you get home late at night, are there not the great masters
      who love you?

    <p>
      Thou wouldst call thyself Artist; thou wouldst have the Eternal Presence
      to dwell within thee, to fire thy heart with passion and dower thy lips
      with song; canst thou go into thy closet, and alone with thy Maker, say
      these words:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O Thou Unthinkable, source of all light and life, Thou the great
      unselfish One, the great Sufferer; Thou seest my heart this day, how in it
      dwells but love of Thy truth and worship of Thy holiness. Thou seest that
      I seek not wealth that men should serve me, nor fame that they should
      honor me, for the glory that is Thine. Thou seest that I bring all my
      praise to Thy feet, that I love all things that Thou hast made, that I
      envy no man Thy gifts, that I rejoice when Thou sendest one stronger than
      I into the battle. And when these things are not, may Thy power leave me;
      for I seek but to dwell in Thy presence, and to speak Thy truth, which can
      not die.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      That prayer welled up in my heart to-day. There are times when I sit
      before this thing in my soul, crouching and gazing at it in fear. Then I
      see the naked horror of it, the shuddering reality of it. I see the Soul:
      motionless, tense, quivering, wrestling in an agony with the powers of
      destruction. It is so real to me that my body stiffens into stone, and I
      sit with the sweat on my forehead. That happened to me to-day, and I wrote
      a few lines of the poem that made my voice break&mdash;the passionate
      despairing cry for deliverance, for rest from the terror.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there is no rest. The mountain slope is so that there is no standing
      upon it, and once you stop, it breaks your heart to begin again. And so
      you go on&mdash;up&mdash;up&mdash;and there is not any summit.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is that way when you write a book; and that way when you make a
      symphony; and that way when you wage a war.

    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      But my soul hungered for it. I have loved the great elemental art-works&mdash;the
      art-works that were born of pure suffering. For months before I began The
      Captive I read but three books&mdash;read them and brooded over them, all
      day and all night. They were Prometheus Bound, Prometheus Unbound, and
      Samson Agonistes.
    </p>
    <p>
      You sit with these books, and time and space &ldquo;to nothingness do sink.&rdquo;
       There looms up before you&mdash;like a bare mountain in its majesty&mdash;the
      great elemental world-fact, the death-grapple of the will with
      circumstance. You may build yourself any philosophy or any creed you
      please, but you will never get away from the world-fact&mdash;the
      death-grapple of the soul with circumstance. Æschylus has one creed, and
      Milton has another, and Shelley has a third; but always it is the
      death-grapple. Chaos, evil&mdash;circumstance&mdash;lies about you, binds
      you; and you grip it&mdash;you close with it&mdash;all your days you toil
      with it, you shape it into systems, you make it live and laugh and sing.
      And while you do that, there is in your heart a thing that is joy and pain
      and terror mingled in one passion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Who knows that passion? Who knows&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;With travail and heavy sorrow
   The holy spirit of Man.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Prometheus Bound, Prometheus Unbound, and Samson Agonistes! And now there
      will be a fourth. It will be The Captive.
    </p>
    <p>
      Am I a fool? I do not know&mdash;that is none of my business. It is my
      business to do my best.

      Horace bids you, if you would make him weep, to weep first yourself. I
      understand by the writing of a poem just this: that the problem you put
      there you discover for yourself; that the form you put it in you invent
      for yourself; and, finally, that what you make it, from the first word to
      the last word, from the lowest moment to the highest moment, you <i>live</i>;
      that when a character in such a place acts thus, he acts thus because you,
      in that place&mdash;not would have acted thus, but <i>did</i> act thus;
      that the words which are spoken in that moment of emotion are spoken
      because you, in that moment of emotion&mdash;not would have spoken them,
      but <i>did</i> speak them. I propose that you search out the scenes that
      have stirred the hearts of men in all times, and see if you can find one
      that was written thus&mdash;not because the author had lived it thus, but
      because somebody else had lived it thus, or because he wanted people to
      think he had lived it thus.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now you are writing The Captive. You do not go into the dungeon in the
      body, because you need all your strength; but in the spirit you have gone
      into the dungeon, and the door has clanged, and it is black night&mdash;the
      world is gone forever. And there you sit, while the years roll by, and you
      front the naked fact. Six feet square of stone and an iron chain are your
      portion&mdash;that is circumstance; and the will&mdash;<i>you</i> are the
      will. And you grip it&mdash;you close with it&mdash;all your days you toil
      with it; you shape it into systems, make it live and laugh and sing. And
      while you do that there is in your heart a thing that is joy and pain and
      terror mingled in one passion.

      Yes, sometimes I shrink from it; but I will do it&mdash;meaning what those
      words mean. I will fight that fight, I will live that life&mdash;to the
      last gasp; and it shall go forth into the world a living thing, a new
      well-spring of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      It shall be&mdash;I don't know what you call the thing, but when you have
      hauled your load halfway up the hill you put a block in the way to keep it
      from sliding back. That same thing has to be done to society.

      Man will never get behind the Declaration of Independence again, nor

      teeth.

    </p>
    <p>
      I was thinking to-day, that The Captive would be an interesting document
      to students of style. Read it, and make up your mind about it; then I will
      tell you&mdash;the first line of it is almost the first line of blank
      verse I ever wrote in my life.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have read about the French artists, the great masters of style, and how
      they give ten years of their lives to writing things that are never
      published. But I have noticed that when they are masters at last, and when
      they do begin to publish&mdash;they very seldom have anything to say that
      I care in the least to hear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &mdash;My soul is centered upon <i>the thing</i>!
    </p>
    <p>
      Let it be a test.

    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      I am trying to be an artist; but I have never been able to study style. I
      believe that the style of this great writer came from what he had to say.
      You think about how he said it; but he thought about what he was saying.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed strange to me when I thought of it. With all my trembling
      eagerness, with all my preparation, such an idea as &ldquo;practise&rdquo; never came
      to me. How could I cut the path until I had come to the forest?
    </p>
    <p>
      All my soul has been centered upon <i>living</i>. Since this book first
      took hold of me&mdash;eighteen months ago&mdash;I could not tell with what
      terrible intensity I have lived it. They said to me, &ldquo;You are a poet; why
      don't you write verses for the magazines?&rdquo; But I was not a writer of
      verses for the magazines.
    </p>
    <p>
      It has been a shrine that I have kept in the corner of my heart, and
      tended there. I have never gone near it, except upon my knees. There were
      days when I did not go near it at all, when I was weak, or distraught. But
      I knew that every day I was closer to the task, that every day my heart
      was more full of it. It was like wild music&mdash;it came to a climax that
      swept me away in spite of myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      To get the mastery of your soul, to hold it here, in your hands, at your
      bidding, to consecrate your life to that, to watch and pray and toil for
      that, to rouse yourself and goad yourself day and night for that; to
      thrill with the memory of great consecrations, of heroic sufferings and
      aspirations; to have the power of the stars in your heart, of nature, of
      history and the soul of man; <i>that</i> is your &ldquo;practise.&rdquo;

      book, that this book is the climax of my whole life. I have toiled&mdash;learned&mdash;built

      tried to write anything, to be published. I have said, &ldquo;Wait; it is not

      I have done, it is in this book.

    </p>
    <p>
      I saw my soul to-day. It was a bubble, blown large, palpitating, whirling
      over a stormy sea; glorious with the rainbow hues it was, but perilous,
      abandoned.&mdash;Do you catch the <i>feeling</i> of my soul?
    </p>
    <p>
      Something perilous&mdash;I do not much care what. A traveler scaling the
      mountains, leaping upon dizzy heights; a gambler staking his fortune, his
      freedom, his life&mdash;upon a cast!
    </p>
    <p>
      I will tell you about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      It began when I was fifteen. My great-uncle, my guardian, is a wholesale
      grocer in Chicago; he has a large palace and a large waistcoat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you be a wholesale grocer?&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I will not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I might have been a partner by this time, had I said Yes, and had a palace
      and a large waistcoat too.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then what will you be?&rdquo; asked the great-uncle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will be a poet,&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean you will be a loafer?&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said I&mdash;disliking argument&mdash;&ldquo;I will be a loafer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And so I went away, and while I went I was thinking, far down in my soul.
      And I said: &ldquo;It must be everything or nothing; either I am a poet or I am
      not. I will act as if I were; I will burn my bridges behind me. If I am, I
      will win&mdash;for you can not kill a poet; and if I am not, I will die.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus is it perilous.
    </p>
    <p>
      I fight the fight with all my soul; I give every ounce of my strength, my
      will, my hope, to the making of myself a poet. And when the time comes I
      write my poem. Then if I win, I win empires; and if I lose&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You put all your eggs into one basket,&rdquo; some one once said to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;I put all my eggs into one basket&mdash;and then I
      carry the basket myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now I have come to the last stage of the journey&mdash;the &ldquo;one fight
      more, and the last.&rdquo; And can I give any idea of what is back of me, to
      nerve me to that fight? I will try to tell you.
    </p>
    <p>
      For seven years I have borne poverty and meanness, sickness, heat, cold,
      toil&mdash;that I might make myself an artist. The indignities, the
      degradations&mdash;I could not tell them, if I spent all the time I have
      in writing a journal. I have lived in garrets&mdash;among dirty people&mdash;vulgar
      people&mdash;vile people; I have worn rags and unclean things; I have
      lived upon bread and water and things that I have cooked myself; I have
      seen my time and my strength wasted by a thousand hateful impertinences&mdash;I
      have been driven half mad with pain and rage; I have gone without friends&mdash;I
      have been hated by every one; I have worked at all kinds of vile drudgery&mdash;or
      starved myself sick that I might avoid working.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I have said, &ldquo;I will be an artist!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Day and night I have dreamed it; day and night I have fought for it. I
      have plotted and planned&mdash;I have plotted to save a minute. I have
      done menial work that I might have my brain free&mdash;all the languages
      that I know I have worked at at such times. I have calculated the cost of
      foods&mdash;I have lived on a third of the pittance I earned, that I might
      save two-thirds of my time. I once washed dishes in a filthy restaurant
      because that took only two or three hours a day.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have said, &ldquo;I will be an artist! I will fix my eyes upon the goal; I
      will watch and wait, and fight the fight day by day. And when at last I am
      strong, and when my message is ripe, I will earn myself a free chance, and
      then I will write a book. All the yearning, all the agony of this my life
      I will put into it; every hour of trial, every burst of rage. I will make
      it the hope of my life, I will write it with my blood&mdash;give every
      ounce of strength that I have and every dollar that I own; and I will win&mdash;I
      will win!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I will be free, and the horror will be over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I have done that&mdash;I am doing that now. I mean to finish it if it
      kills me.&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      But I was sitting on the edge of the bed to-night, and the tears came into
      my eyes and I whispered: &ldquo;But oh, you must not ask me to do anymore! I can
      not do any more! It will leave me broken!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Only so much weight can a man carry. The next pound breaks his back.

    <p>
      To-day was one day in fifty. Why should it be? Sometimes I have but to
      spread my wings to the wind. Yesterday I might have torn my hair out, and
      that glory would not have come to me. But to-day I was filled with it&mdash;it
      lived in me and burned in me&mdash;I had but to go on and go on.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Captive! It was the burst of rage&mdash;the first glow in the ashes of
      despair. I was walking up and down the room for an hour, thundering it to
      myself. I have not gotten over the joy of it yet: <i>&ldquo;Thou in thy mailèd
      insolence!&rdquo;</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      I wonder if any one who reads those thirty lines will realize that they
      meant eight hours of furious toil on my part!

      Stone by stone I build it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The whole possibility of a scene&mdash;that is what I pant for, always;
      that it should be all there, and yet not a line to spare; compact, solid,
      each phrase coming like a blow; and above all else, that it should be
      inevitable! When you stand upon the height of your being, and behold the
      thing with all your faculties&mdash;the thing and the phrase are one, and
      one to all eternity.

      April 24th.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was looking at a literary journal to-day. Oh, my soul, it frightens me!
      All these libraries of books&mdash;who reads them, what are they for? And
      each one of them a hope! And I am to leap over them all&mdash;I&mdash;I? I
      dare not think about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have been helpless to-day. I can not find what I want&mdash;I struggled
      for hours, I wore myself out with struggling. And I have torn up what I
      wrote.
    </p>
    <p>
      Blank verse is such a&mdash;such a thing not to be spoken of! Is there
      anything worse, except it be a sonnet? How many miles of it are ground out
      every day&mdash;sometimes that kind comes to me to mock me&mdash;I could
      have written a whole poem full of it this afternoon. If there are two
      lines of that sort in The Captive, I'll burn it all.
    </p>
    <p>
      An awful doubt came to me besides. Somebody had sown it long ago, and it
      sprouted to-day. &ldquo;Yes, but will it be <i>interesting</i>?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Heaven help me, how am I to know if it will be interesting? The question
      made me shudder; I have never thought anything about making it interesting&mdash;I've
      been trying to make it true. Can it possibly be that the ecstasy of one
      soul, the reality of one soul, the quivering, exulting life of it&mdash;will
      not interest any other soul?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can you know that what you are doing is real, anyhow?&rdquo; The devil
      would plague me to death to-day. &ldquo;But how many millions write poems and
      think they are wonderful!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &mdash;I do not believe in my soul to-day, because I have none.

      April 25th.
    </p>
    <p>
      Would you like to know where I am, and how I am doing all these things? I
      am in a lodging-house. I have one of three hall rooms in a kind of top
      half-story. There is room for me to take four steps; so it is that I &ldquo;walk
      up and down&rdquo; when I am excited. I have tried&mdash;I have not kept count
      of how many places&mdash;and this is the quietest. The landlady's husband
      has a carpenter shop down-stairs, but he is always drunk and doesn't work;
      it has also been providentially arranged that the daughter, who sings, is
      sick for some time. Next door to me there is a man who plays the 'cello in
      a dance hall until I know not what hour of the night. He keeps his 'cello
      at the dance hall. Next to him is a pale woman who sits and sews all day
      and waits for her drunken husband to come home. In front there is some
      kind of foolish girl who leaves her door open in the hope that I'll look
      in at her, and a couple of inoffensive people not worth describing.
    </p>
    <p>
      I get up&mdash;I never know the time in the morning; and sometimes I lie
      without moving for hours&mdash;thinking&mdash;thinking. Or sometimes I go
      out and roam around the streets; or sit perfectly motionless, gazing at
      the wall. When it will not come, I make it. I breakfast on bread and milk,
      and I eat bread and milk at all hours of the day when I am hungry. For
      dinner I cook a piece of meat on a little oil-stove, and for supper I eat
      bread and milk. The rest of the time I am sitting on the floor by the
      window, writing; or perhaps kneeling by the bed with my head buried in my
      arms, and thinking until the room reels. When I am not doing that I wander
      around like a lost soul; I can not think of anything else.&mdash;Sometimes
      when I am tired and must rest, I force myself to sit down and write some
      of this.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have just forty dollars now. It costs me three dollars a week, not
      including paper and typewriting. Thus I have ten or twelve weeks in which
      to finish The Captive&mdash;that many and no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      If I am not finished by that time it will kill me; to try to work and earn
      money in the state that I am in just at present would turn me into a
      maniac&mdash;I should kill some one, I know.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am quivering with nervous tension&mdash;every faculty strained to
      breaking; the buzz of a fly is a roar to me. I build up these towering
      castles of emotion in my soul, castles that shimmer in the sunlight:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Banners yellow, glorious, golden!
</pre>
    <p>
      And then something happens, and they fall upon me with the weight of
      mountains.

    <p>
      Ten weeks! And yet it is not that which goads me most.
    </p>
    <p>
      What goads me most is that I am a captive in a dungeon, and am fighting
      for the life of my soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      I shall win, I do not fear&mdash;the fountains of my being will not fail
      me. I saw my soul a second time to-day; it was no longer the bubble, blown
      large, palpitating. It was a bird resting upon a bough. The bough was
      tossed and flung about by a tempest; and a chasm yawned below; but the
      bough held, and the bird was master of its wings, and sang.
    </p>
    <p>
      The name of the bough was Faith.

      April 27th.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have read a great deal of historical romance, and a great deal of local
      color fiction, and a great deal of original character-drawing&mdash;and I
      have wished to get away from these things.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is no local color, and no character-drawing, in The Captive. You do
      not know the name of the hero; you do not know how old he is, or of what
      rank he is, at what period or in what land he lives. He is described but
      once. He is &ldquo;A Man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My philosophy is a philosophy of will. All virtue that I know is
      conditioned upon freedom. The object of all thinking and doing, as I see
      it, is to set men free.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is the tyranny of kings&mdash;the tyranny of force; there is the
      tyranny of priests&mdash;the tyranny of ignorance; there is the tyranny of
      society&mdash;the tyranny of selfishness and indolence; and above all, and
      including all, and causing all&mdash;there is the tyranny of self&mdash;the
      tyranny of sin, the tyranny of the body. So it is that I see the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      So it is that I see history; I can see nothing else in history. The
      tyranny of kings and nobles, the tyranny of the mass and the inquisition,
      the tyranny of battle and murder and crime&mdash;how was a man to live in
      those ages?
    </p>
    <p>
      How is a man to live in <i>this</i> age? The tyranny of kings and of
      priests is gone, and from the tyranny of industrialism the individual can
      escape. But the lightning&mdash;is not that an inquisition? And if it
      comes after you, will it not find out all your secrets? And the tyranny of
      hurricane and shipwreck, of accident, disease, and death? Any tyranny is
      all tyranny, I say; and the existence of tyranny is its presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is conceivable that some day the sovereign mind may shake off its
      shackles, and the tyranny of matter be at an end. But that day is not yet;
      and meanwhile, the thing existing, how shall a man be free? That has been
      the matter of my deepest brooding.
    </p>
    <p>
      This much I have learned:
    </p>
    <p>
      The man may accept this life, if it please him, and its chances; but while
      he does he can never be a soul. So long as he accepts this life and its
      chances, he is the slave of tyranny. When the day comes that mind is
      sovereign, I will give myself into the hands of this life. But meanwhile I
      will know myself for what I am&mdash;a bubble upon the surface of a
      whirling torrent, an insect borne aloft upon a flying wheel.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      It is by your will that you are free; by your will you are one with the
      infinite freedom, by your will you are master of time and your fate, lord
      of the stars and the endless ages, thinker of all truth, hearer of all
      music, beholder of all beauty, doer of all righteousness. That is the
      truth which I have brought out of my deepest brooding.
    </p>
    <p>
      So long as your happiness is in anything about yourself&mdash;your wealth,
      or your fame, or your life&mdash;you are not free. So long as your
      happiness is in houses and lands, in sons and in daughters, you are not
      free. You give one atom of your soul to these things at your own peril;
      for when your hour comes you tear them from you, though they be as your
      eyes; and by your <i>will</i> you save your soul alive.
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore I write The Captive. I put aside childish things&mdash;I grip my
      hands upon naked Reality.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      There are nine characters in The Captive: a tyrant, two slaves, six
      guests, and a man. There are two scenes&mdash;a dungeon, and a
      banquet-hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      A tyrant: I understand by a tyrant a man whose happiness is the
      unhappiness of others. I read of the discoverers of Mexico, and how they
      found a pyramid of human skulls, raised as a monument; that has been to
      me, ever since, the type of tyranny. The forms of tyranny vary through the
      ages, but the principle is always the same; a tyrant is a man who is made
      great by the toil and sorrow of others.
    </p>
    <p>
      The slave also remains the same through all time; and likewise the guest.
      The guest is the man who takes the world as he finds it, and likes a good
      dinner. The population of society is made up of tyrants, slaves, and
      guests.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man is a character of my own imagining.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first scene of The Captive is the dungeon. When I was very young I was
      in Europe, and I was in a dungeon; I have never forgotten it. There enter
      the tyrant and the two slaves with the man. They chain him to the wall,
      and then the tyrant speaks. That first speech&mdash;I have written it now&mdash;I
      have gotten the hammer-thuds! Tyranny is an iron thing&mdash;you had to
      feel the tread of it, the words had to roll like thunder. It is an
      advantage to me that I am full of Wagner; I always hear the music with my
      poetry. (I shall be disappointed if some one does not make an opera out of
      The Captive.)
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The man is there, and he is there forever. After that, once a day, bread
      and water are shoved in through an opening. But the door of the dungeon
      does not open again until the last act&mdash;when ten years have passed.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      That is all. And now the man will battle with that problem. Will he go mad
      with despair? Will he sink into a wild beast? Will he commit suicide? Or
      what <i>will</i> he do? Day by day he sinks back from the question, numb
      with agony; day by day the grim hand of Fate drags him to it; and so,
      until from the chaos of his soul he digs out, blow by blow, a faith.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here there will be Reality; no shams and no lies will do here&mdash;here
      is iron necessity, and cries out for iron truth. God&mdash;duty&mdash;will&mdash;virtue&mdash;let
      such things no more be names, let us see what they <i>are</i>!
    </p>
    <p>
      These are awful words. Sometimes I shrink from this thing as from fire,
      sometimes I rush to it with a song; I am writing about it now because I am
      worn out, and yet I can not think of anything else.
    </p>
    <p>
      This man will find the truth; being delivered from the captivity of the
      world and set free to be a soul. Superstition blinds him; doubt and
      despair and weakness blind him; but still he gropes and strives, cries out
      and battles for truth; until at last, shut up in his own being, he tears
      his way out to the very source of it, and knows for himself what it is. <i>Infinite
      it is, and unthinkable; glorious, all-consuming, all-sufficing; food and
      drink, friendship and love, ambition and victory, joy, power, and eternity
      it is to him who finds it; and all things in this world are nothing to him
      who finds it.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      And so comes the victory to this soul. Hour by hour he catches gleams of
      the light; day by day he toils toward it, with fear and agony and prayer;
      until at last he knows his salvation&mdash;to rest never, and to toil
      always, and to dwell in this Presence of his God. In one desperate hour he
      flings away the world and the hope of the world, and vows this
      consecration, and lives.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      He keeps the vow; it is iron necessity that drives him. He finds himself,
      he finds his way&mdash;each day his step is surer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each day the channels of his being deepen. He lays broad plans for his
      life&mdash;he gathers all knowledge, he solves all problems; lord of the
      infinite mind, he ranges all existence, and beholds it as the symbol of
      himself. Into the deeps and yawning spaces of it he plunges; blind, he
      sees what men have never seen; deaf, he hears what men have never heard&mdash;singer
      he is, prophet and poet and maker. New worlds leap into being in the
      infinite fulness of his heart, visions of endless glory that make his
      senses reel; as a column of incense towering to the sky is the ecstasy of
      his adoration and his joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      And so the long years roll by; and the unconquered spirit has left the
      earth: left time and space and self, and dwells where never man has dwelt
      before. And then one day the door of the dungeon is opened, and his chains
      are shattered, and the slaves lead him up to the light of day.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is the banquet-hall; and there is the tyrant, and there the guests&mdash;there
      is the world.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      He is aged, and weak, and white, and terrible. They stare at him; and he
      stares at them, for he is dazed. They begin to mock at him, and then at
      last he realizes, and he covers his face and weeps&mdash;beholding the
      world, and the way that it must come. They jeer at him, they strike him;
      and when he answers not, they call to the slaves to torture him.

      I recall the highest moment of my being. I saw that moment, and all the
      others of my life. I saw them as something that I could not bear to see,
      and I cried out that from that hour I would change them. I have not kept
      the vow; there was no one to drive me.
    </p>
    <p>
      But this man they drive; they pinch him and burn him and tear him; they
      crush his limbs, they break his bones, they grind his flesh, they make his
      brain a living fire of anguish. And he fights them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Into the deep recesses of his being goes the cry&mdash;for all that he has&mdash;for
      all that he is! For every ounce of his strength, for every throb of his
      will, for every vision, every truth that he knows! To bear this, to save
      him here! And so he wrestles, so he rises, so he gropes and gasps; and in
      the moment of his fiercest straining, with the throb of all his being he
      bursts the barrier, he rends the veil; and infinite passion rolls in in
      floods upon him, he clutches all existence in his arms; and from his lips
      there bursts a mad frenzied shout of rapture&mdash;that makes his
      torturers stand transfixed, listening, trembling with terror.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so they drag him back to his dungeon; and there, unable to move, he
      lies upon the stones and pants out his ecstasy and his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      That is The Captive.

      What counts in this thing is momentum&mdash;spiritual momentum. You are
      filled with it all the time, it never leaves you; it drives behind you
      like a gale of wind; it roars in your ears when you are awake, it rocks
      you to sleep when you are weary; whenever you are dull or do not heed it,
      it nags at you, it goads you, it beats into your face. Each day it is
      more, each day it is harder, more unattainable; but only do not stop, it
      carries you with it like a wave; you mount upon each day's achievement to
      reach the next, you move with the power of all the days before. It is
      momentum that counts.

      It is weak of me, but sometimes I can not help but look ahead&mdash;and
      think that it is done! I could not find any words to tell the joy that
      that will be to me&mdash;to be free, after so long&mdash;to be free!
    </p>
    <p>
      I do not care anything about the fame&mdash;it would not be anything to me
      to be a great author. If it could be done, nothing would please me better
      than to publish it anonymously&mdash;to let no one ever know that it was
      mine. If I could only have the little that I need to be free, I would
      publish all that I might ever write anonymously.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, that is the thing that makes my blood bound. To be free! Let it only
      be done&mdash;let it only be real, as it will be&mdash;and the naked force
      of it will shake men to the depths of their souls. I could not write it,
      if I did not believe that I was writing words that would grip the soul of
      any man&mdash;I care not how dull or how coarse he might be.

      stairs with it&mdash;God damn his soul! And there he sits, sawing away at
      some loathsome jig tunes! And he has two friends in there&mdash;I listen
      to their wit between the tunes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here I sit, like a wild beast pent in a cage. I tell you I can bear any
      work in the world, but I can not bear things such as this. That I, who am
      seeking a new faith for men&mdash;who am writing, or trying to write, what
      will mean new life to millions&mdash;should have my soul ripped into
      pieces by such loathsome, insulting indignities!
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, laugh!&mdash;but <i>I</i> can't laugh&mdash;I sit here foaming at the
      lips, and crying! And suppose he's lost his position, and does this every
      day!
    </p>
    <p>
      Now every day I must lay aside what I am doing and sit and shudder when I
      hear him coming up the steps&mdash;and wait for him to begin this! I tell
      you, I demand to be free&mdash;I <i>demand</i> it! I want nothing in this
      world but to be let alone. I don't want anybody to wait on me.&mdash;<i>I
      don't want anything from this hellish world but to be let alone!</i>

      It is pouring rain outside, and my overcoat is thin; but I must go out and

    <p>
      All day wasted! All day! Does it not seem that these things persecute you
      by system? I came in, cold and wet, and got into bed, and then he began
      again! And the friends came back and they had beer, and more music. And I
      had to get up and put on the wet clothes once more.

      I was crouching out on one of the docks last night. I had no place else to
      go. I can think anywhere, if it is quiet.
    </p>
    <p>
      A wonderful thing is the night. I bless Thee for the night, oh &ldquo;<i>süsse,
      heilige Natur</i>&rdquo;!
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a voice in my soul, as clear as could be.
    </p>
    <p>
      &mdash;She can not bear too long the sight of men, sweet, holy Nature: the
      swarming hives&mdash;the millions of tiny creatures, each drunk and blind
      with his own selfishness; and so she lays her great hand upon it all, and
      hides it out of her sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once it was all silent, and formless as the desert; soon it shall all be
      silent and formless again; and meanwhile&mdash;the night, the night!

      for beauty, I want the earth stern and forbidding. Give me some place
      where no one else would want to go&mdash;an iron crag where the oceans
      beat&mdash;a mountain-top where the lightning splinters on the rocks.

      I go at it again. But I am nervous&mdash;these things get me into such a
      state that I simply can not do anything. It was not merely yesterday&mdash;I
      have it constantly. The dirty chambermaid singing, or yelling down to the
      landlady; the drunken man swearing at his wife; the boys screaming in the
      street and kicking a tomato-can about. When I think of how much beauty and
      power has been shattered in my life by such things as these, it brings
      tears of impotent rage into my eyes.
    </p>
    <p>

      I wonder if I do not give too much. Once I climbed to a dizzy height, and
      I cried out a dizzy truth:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O God, how as nothing in Thy sight are my writings!&rdquo;

    <p>
      To all that I have lived, and known, and seen, I have but one word, one
      cry&mdash;Away! Away! Let me get away from it! Let me get away from
      cities, let me get away from men, let me out of my cage! Let me go with my
      God, let me forget it all&mdash;put it away forever and ever! Let me no

      a burning fire, to be hungry and swift as the Autumn wind, to have a heart

      in this seething hell of selfishness, this orgy of folly.

      I wrote a little poem once. I remembered two lines of it&mdash;a nature

      an application of them that was a stroke of genius, I believe. I was
      passing the Stock Exchange. It was a very busy day. I climbed one of the
      pillars, in spirit, and wrote high above the portals:
    </p>

      A dreadful thing is unbelief! A dreadful thing it is to be an infidel!
    </p>
    <p>
      &mdash;That is what all men cry nowadays&mdash;there is so much infidelity
      in the world&mdash;it is the curse of our modern society&mdash;it is
      everywhere&mdash;it is all-prevailing!
    </p>
    <p>
      I had a strange experience to-day, Sunday. I went into a church, and high
      up by the altar, dressed in solemn garb and offering prayers to God&mdash;I
      saw an infidel!
    </p>
    <p>
      He preached a sermon. The theme of his sermon was &ldquo;Liberalism.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These men,&rdquo; cried the preacher, &ldquo;are blinding our eyes to our salvation,
      they are undermining, day by day, our faith! They tell us that the sacred
      word of God is 'literature'! And they show us more 'literature'; but oh,
      my friends, what new <i>Bible</i> have they shown us!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As I got up and went out of that church, I whispered: &ldquo;What a dreadful
      thing it is to be an infidel!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Oh Dante and Goethe and Shakespeare&mdash;oh Wordsworth and Shelley and
      Emerson! Oh thrice-anointed and holy spirits! What a dreadful thing it is
      to be an infidel!
    </p>
    <p>
      What a dreadful thing it is to believe in a Bible, and not to believe in
      literature&mdash;to believe in a Bible and not to believe in a God!
    </p>
    <p>
      You think that this world lives upon the revelation of two thousand years
      ago! Fool&mdash;this world lives as your body lives by the beating of its
      heart&mdash;upon the revelation and the effort of each instant of its
      life. And to-day or to-morrow the great Revealer might send to some lonely
      thinker in his garret a new word that would scatter to dust and ashes all
      laws and all duties that now are known to men.

      There are many ways to look at the world, and always a deeper one. I see
      it as a fearful thing, towering, expanding, upheld by the toil and the
      agony of millions. Who will bring us the new hope, the new song of
      courage, that it go not down into the dust to-day?
    </p>
    <p>
      To do that there is the poet; to live and to die unheeded, and to feed for
      ages upon ages the hungry souls of men&mdash;that is to be a poet.
      Therefore will he sing, and sing ever, and die in the sweetness of his
      song.

    <p>
      When I think of that&mdash;not now as I write it here in bare words&mdash;but

      Chiefest of all I think of my country! Passionately, more than words can
      utter, I love this land of mine. If I tear my heart till it bleeds and
      pour out the tears of my spirit, it is for this consecration and this hope&mdash;it
      is for this land of Washington and Lincoln. There never was any land like
      it&mdash;there may never be any like it again; and Freedom watches from
      her mountains, trembling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &mdash;It is a song that it needs, a song and a singer; to point it to its
      high design, to thrill it with the music of its message, to shake the
      heart of every man in it, and make him burn and dare! For the first time
      there is Liberty; for the first time there is Truth, and no shams and no
      lies, enthroned. The news of it has gone forth like the sound of thunder,
      and has shaken all the earth: that man at last may live, may do what he
      can and will!
    </p>
    <p>
      &mdash;And to what is it? Is it to the heaping up of ugly cities, the
      packing of pork and the gathering of gold? That is the thing that I toil
      for&mdash;to tear this land from the grasp of mean men and of merchants!
      To take the souls of my countrymen into the high mountains with me, to
      thrill them with a soaring, strong resolve! <i>Living things</i> shall
      come from this land of mine, living things before I die, for the hunger of
      it burns me, and will not ever let me rest. Freedom! freedom! And stern
      justice and honor, and knowledge and power, and a noonday blaze of light!

    <p>
      I have been for two days in the mire. I was disturbed, and then I was
      sluggish. Oh, the sluggishness of my nature!
    </p>
    <p>
      If ever I am a great poet, I will have made myself that by the power of my
      will; that is a fact. I am by nature a great clod&mdash;I feel nothing, I
      care about nothing. I look at the flowers as a cow chewing its cud.&mdash;It
      is only that I <i>will</i> to do right.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes the sight of my dulness drives me wild. Then again I merely gaze
      at it. I try time and again to get my mind on my work, and something&mdash;anything,
      provided it is trivial enough&mdash;turns me aside. Just now I saw a
      spider-web, and that made me think of Bruce, and thence I went by way of
      Walter Scott to Palestine, and when I came to I was writing a song for&mdash;who
      was the minstrel?&mdash;to sing outside of the prison of Coeur de Lion.
    </p>
    <p>
      I go wandering that way&mdash;sometimes I sit so for an hour; and then
      suddenly I leap up with a cry. But I may try all I please&mdash;I don't
      care anything about the work&mdash;it doesn't stir me&mdash;the verses I
      think of make me sick. And then I remember that I have only so many weeks
      more; and what it will mean to fail; and that makes me desperate, but
      doesn't help.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I have stopped at some resting-place in the poem, I can get going
      again. But now I have stopped in the middle of a climax; and the number of
      times that I have read that last line, trying to find another&mdash;Great
      heavens!

    </p>
    <p>
      I know perfectly well what I shall do, only I am a coward, and do not do
      it. I shall stay in this state till my rage has heaped itself up enough
      and breaks through everything at last. And then I shall begin to hammer
      myself! to swear at myself in a way that would make a longshoreman turn
      white. And I shall spend perhaps two or three hours&mdash;perhaps two or
      three days&mdash;doing that, until I am quite in a white heat; and then&mdash;I
      shall go to my work.

      Some days ago I was writing in a frenzy&mdash;and the landlady came for
      her rent. And the horrible creature standing there, talking at me! &ldquo;So
      lonely!&mdash;don't ever see people! Mrs. Smithers was a-saying&mdash;&rdquo;
       Oh, damn Mrs. Smithers!
    </p>
    <p>
      I thought I could never do it&mdash;I was really about to give it up. I
      went out on the street&mdash;I roamed about for hours, talking I don't
      know what nonsense to myself. And then at last I came home, and I knelt
      down there at the bedside and said: &ldquo;Here you stay without anything to eat
      until you've written ten lines of that poem!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And that was how I did it. I stayed there, and I prayed. I don't often
      pray, but that time I prayed like one possessed&mdash;I was so lonely and
      so helpless&mdash;and the work was so beautiful. I stayed there for nine
      blessed hours, and then the clock stopped and I couldn't count after that.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the day came, and then the ten lines! And so I had my breakfast.
    </p>
    <p>
      These things leave you weak, but a little less dull.

      I have been working with a kind of wild desperation all day to-day. Oh it
      hurts&mdash;it hurts&mdash;but I am doing it! Whenever I read some lines
      of it that are real&mdash;whenever some great living phrase flashes over
      me&mdash;then I laugh like a man in the midst of a battle.
    </p>
    <p>
      I shall be just as a man who has been through a battle; haggard and wild
      and desperate. Oh, I don't think I shall <i>ever</i> have the courage to
      do it again!
    </p>
    <p>
      I did not know what it meant! I did not! It was giving myself into the
      hands of a fiend!
    </p>
    <p>
      All great books will be something different to me after this. Did
      Shakespeare write thus with the blood of his soul? Or am I weak? Did he
      ever cry out in pain, as I have?

      Another day of raw torture. It is like toiling up a mountain side; and
      your limbs are of lead. It is like struggling in a nightmare,&mdash;that
      is just what it is like. It is sickening.
    </p>

      I could hardly stand up this afternoon! but the thing was ringing in my
      ears&mdash;it went on and on&mdash;I had to go after it! I was in the

      made no difference how hard&mdash;it called to me&mdash;on&mdash;on! And I
      said: &ldquo;Suppose I were to be tortured&mdash;could I go then?&rdquo; And so I went

      I wrote what I had to write the day before yesterday&mdash;I could not
      help it. But when I stopped my head was literally on fire, and the
      strangest mad throbbing in it&mdash;I stood still in fear, it felt so as
      if something were going to burst&mdash;my head seemed to weigh a ton. I
      poured cold water over it, but it made no difference&mdash;it stayed that
      way all night and all yesterday.
    </p>
    <p>
      What am I to do? I dare not think&mdash;I took a long walk, and even now I
      find myself thinking of the book without knowing it. Imagine me sitting on
      a doorstep and playing for two hours with a kitten!

      I feel better to-day, but I hardly know what to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime I was happy!&mdash;Think of a poet's being happy with city
      flowers! of a poet's being happy with store-flowers&mdash;prostitute-flowers&mdash;flowers
      for sale!
    </p>
    <p>
      It was all about a narcissus&mdash;&ldquo;Very flower of youth, and morning's
      golden hour!&rdquo;&mdash;as I called it once. And it danced so! (It was out on
      the curbstone)&mdash;and I went off happy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then I thought of a poem that is pure distilled ecstasy to my spirit. I
      will write it, and be happy again:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Sit thee by the ingle, when
  The sear faggot blazes bright;
  Spirit of a winter's night!&mdash; ...
  Sit thee there, and send abroad,
  With a mind self-overaw'd,
  Fancy, high-commission'd:&mdash;send her!
  She has vassals to attend her;
  She will bring, in spite of frost,
  Beauties that the earth hath lost;
  She will bring thee, all together,
  All delights of summer weather;
  All the buds and bells of May,
  From dewy sward or thorny spray;
  All the heaped Autumn's wealth,
  With a still, mysterious stealth;
  She will mix those pleasures up,
  Like three fit wines in a cup,
  And thou shall quaff it!&mdash;
</pre>
    <p>
      Ah! And so I went along, &ldquo;sun, moon, and stars forgot&rdquo;&mdash;laughing and
      half dancing. People stared at me&mdash;and I laughed. And then I passed
      three pretty girls, and I laughed, and they laughed too. I guess they
      thought I was going to follow them.
    </p>
    <p>

      in this world, except listen to music.

      I often think how I shall spend my money after The Captive is done. I
      shall take a band of chosen youths, seekers and worshipers, and we shall
      build a house on a mountain-top and worship the Lord in the beauty of
      music!
    </p>
    <p>
      I shall have to begin at the beginning&mdash;I have never had any one to
      teach me music. But oh, if I did know!&mdash;And if I ever got hold of an
      orchestra&mdash;<i>how</i> I would make it go!
    </p>
    <p>
      And in the middle of it the astonished orchestra would see the conductor
      take wings unto himself and fly off through the roof.
    </p>
    <p>
      A book that I mean to write some day will be called The Pleasures of
      Music, and it will sing the joys of being clean and strong, of cold water
      and the early morning and a free heart. It will show how all the
      unhappiness of men is that they live in the body and in self, and how the
      world is to be saved through music, which is not of the body, nor of self&mdash;which
      is free and infinite, swift as the winds, vast as the oceans, endless as
      time, and happy as whole meadows of flowers! The more who come to partake
      of it, the better it is; for generous is &ldquo;Frau Musika,&rdquo; her heart is made
      wholly of love.
    </p>
    <p>
      &mdash;And when I have shown all these things, Frau Musika, I shall tell
      of the golden lands that I have visited upon the wings of thy spirit!&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">

      I have never seen but one beautiful thing in New York, and that is its
      mighty river in the night-time. I wander down to the docks when my work is
      done, and when it is still; I sit and gaze at it until the city is quite
      gone, and all its restlessness,&mdash;until there is but that grave
      presence, rolling restlessly, silently, as it has rolled for ages. It
      makes no comments; it has seen many things.
    </p>
    <p>
      To-night I sat and watched it till a tangled forest sprang up about me,
      and I saw a strange, high-bowed, storm-beaten craft glide past me, ghostly

    <h3>
      AN ESSAY AFTER RIGHTEOUSNESS
    </h3>
    <p>
      I write this to set forth a purpose which I have for over a year held
      before me. I write it that it may serve me for a standard. I write it at a
      time when my bank-account consists of twenty-five dollars, and I mean to
      publish it at such a time as by the method of plain living and high
      thinking, I shall have been able to increase it a hundredfold.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are told that a man who would write a great poem must first make a poem
      of his life. An artist, as I understand the word, is a man who has but one
      joy and one purpose and one interest in life&mdash;the creating of beauty;
      he is a man lifted above and set apart from all other motives of men; a
      man who seeks not wealth nor comfort nor fame, nor values these things at
      all; a man whose heart is forever lonely, whose life is an endless sorrow,
      and whose excuse and whose spur and whose goal and whose consecration, is
      the creating of beauty.
    </p>
    <p>
      What power&mdash;be it talent or genius&mdash;God has given me, I can not
      tell; I only know that an artist in that sense of the word I mean to be. I
      have thought out a plan by which I shall make the publishing of my books,
      as well as the writing of them, a thing of Art.
    </p>
    <p>
      No one will read very far in what I shall write without perceiving there a
      savage hatred of the spirit of the modern world of wealth; it is only
      because I have faith in democracy and hope in the people of my country
      that I do not go to worship my God on a desert island. The world which I
      see about me at the present moment&mdash;the world of politics, of
      business, of society&mdash;seems to me a thing demoniac in its
      hideousness; a world gone mad with pride and selfish lust; a world of wild
      beasts writhing and grappling in a pit.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am but a voice crying in the wilderness, and these things must run their
      course. But in the meantime there is one thing that I can do, and the
      doing of that has become with me a passion&mdash;I can keep my own life
      pure; I can see that there is one man amid all this madness whose life is
      untouched by any stain of it; who lives not by bread alone, nor by jewelry
      and gold; who lives not to be stared at and made drunk with pride, but to
      behold beauty and dwell in love; who labors day and night to keep a heart
      full of worship and to sing of faith to suffering men; who takes of the
      reward of that singing just what food and shelter his body needs; and who
      shrinks from wealth and luxury as he would from the mouth of hell.
    </p>
    <p>
      To live humbly and in oblivion would be my choice, but it will be my duty
      to do differently. I know enough about the human heart to know that the
      presence of one righteous man makes ten thousand unrighteous men angry and
      uncomfortable. And therefore, for the help of any whom it may comfort, and
      for the damnation of all the rest, I shall choose that the life I live and
      the thing I do shall be public; I shall choose that the millions in our
      country who are wearing out their frantic lives in the pursuit of the
      dollar, and the few who are squandering their treasures in drunken pomp,
      shall know that there is one man who laughs at them&mdash;whom all the
      millions of all of them could not buy&mdash;and who dwells in joy and
      worship in a heaven of which they can not even know. In other words, it is
      my idea not merely to make a poem of my life, but to publish the poem.
    </p>
    <p>
      I shall have other, and deeper, and kinder reasons also, for what I shall
      do. What I write in my books must be from my deepest heart, the confession
      of those moments of which I would speak to no living soul; it must be all
      my tenderness, and all my rapture, and all my prayer; and do you think it
      will come easily to me to put that out before the rough world to be stared
      at, to be bound up in a book and hawked about by commercial people?...

      Line by line, page by page, I do it. I am counting the days now, wondering&mdash;longing.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not merely the writing of it, it is the seeing of it&mdash;the
      planning and designing. Sometimes I brood over it for hours&mdash;I can
      not find what I want; and then suddenly a phrase flashes over me and like
      a train of gunpowder my thought goes running on&mdash;leaping, flying; and
      then the whole thing is plain as day. And I hold it all living in my
      hands.

    <p>
      I am blessed with a good memory. In times of excitement such as that I
      seize all the best phrases and carry them away, and bury them out of
      sight, like a miser. They are my nuggets of gold.
    </p>
    <p>
      And sometimes I am a greedy miser, and stand perplexed; shall I go on and
      gather more, or shall I make off with the armful that I have?

    <p>
      My religion is my Art. I have no prayer but my work.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes that is a glory, and sometimes again that is an agony. To have
      no duty outside of yourself; to have no inspiration outside of yourself;
      to have no routine to help you, no voice to cry out when your conscience
      goes to sleep, no place of refuge in your weakness!&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      All that is but the reason why I dare not be weak. I have chosen to lead
      and not to follow; therefore I have no rest, and may not look behind me,
      and can think of nothing but the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      To be the maker of a religion is to sweat blood in the night-time.

    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      There is but one way that I may live&mdash;to take every impulse that
      comes&mdash;to be watching, watching&mdash;to dare always and instantly,
      to hesitate, to put off never, to seize the skirt of my muse whenever it
      shimmers before me. So I make myself a habit, a routine, a discipline; and
      so each day I have new power. So each day I feel myself, I bare my arms, I
      walk erect, exulting&mdash;I laugh&mdash;I am a god!
    </p>
    <p>
      &mdash;And as I write that a feeling takes rise in me, and my heart beats
      faster; but I am tired, I sink back, I do not take the gift that is
      offered; and then my conscience gives a growl, and in a flash I see what I
      have done, and feel a throb of rage and leap up.

      never written.

      I am coming, step by step: I mean to fight it out on this line.

      To-day. I had a spiritual experience&mdash;a revelation; to-day, in a
      flash of insight, I understood an age&mdash;whole centuries of time, whole
      nations of men.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had been writing one of the great hymns, one of the great victories; and
      I had been drunk with it, it had come with a surge and a sweep, it had set
      everything about me in motion&mdash;huge phantom shapes&mdash;all life and
      all being gone mad.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then, when I had written it, I went out into the dark night; I walked
      and walked, not knowing where, still tingling with excitement. And,
      suddenly, I stood spellbound&mdash;the cathedral!
    </p>
    <p>
      There it was&mdash;there it was! I saw it, alive and real before me&mdash;all
      of it&mdash;all that I had seen and known! I cried out for joy, I
      stretched out my arms to it&mdash;the great, dark surging presence; and

      I sat to-night by the river again. It was moonlight, and the water lay
      shimmering. A little yacht, gleaming with lights, sped by; it was very
      close, and I saw a group of people on it, I heard them laughing; and one
      of them&mdash;a woman&mdash;was singing.
    </p>
    <p>
      O God, what a voice! So rich, so exquisite! It soared upward and died
      again, quivering like the reflection of the stars on the water. It went in&mdash;in
      to the very depths of my soul; it loosed all the woe of my spirit, it made
      the tears gush into my eyes. And then it died away, away in the distance;
      and I sat with my hands clasped.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sail on&mdash;sail on&mdash;oh heavenly voice! Far-off vision of

      From the time that I began The Captive it has been almost two months; it
      is just six weeks from the day I wrote that I had ten or twelve weeks in
      which to finish. I have done well financially&mdash;I have twenty-one
      dollars left, and I have paid for my typewriting.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not a fortune. But enough is as good as a fortune.

      within sight of the end.

    <p>
      &mdash;That day when I crouched by the bed I saw all of the end. I have
      seen the whole thing. It will leave me a wreck, but I can do it. And it
      will take me about three weeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Think of my being able to say that!&mdash;Five or six hundred lines at
      least I shall have to do, and still I dare to say that. But I am full of

    <p>
      I am sitting down by the window, and first I kick my heels against my old
      trunk, and then I write this. Hi! Hi! I think of a poem that I used to
      recite about Santa Claus&mdash;&ldquo;Ho, Castor! ho, Pollux!&rdquo;&mdash;and then ho
      a lot of other things&mdash;a Donner and a Blitzen I remember in
      particular. I want a reindeer&mdash;a Pegasus&mdash;a Valkyrie&mdash;an
      anything&mdash;to carry me away up into the air where I can exult without
      impropriety!

<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Come blow your horn, hunter,

    <p>
      That's an old Elizabethan song. I heard them come up for his trunk just
      now, and they've dragged it down-stairs, and I hear the landlady fuming
      because they are tearing the wall paper. I have never loved the sound of
      the landlady's voice before.

    <p>
      &mdash;So now I will get to work!
    </p>
    <p>
      &mdash;Moving is noisy; I can't complain. I have been walking about the
      streets. I am hungry for the work; but still, I had much to think of. It

      I have plenty of time to write journals, if I feel like it. There is the
      sister, and there is the landlady, and there is another woman, and they
      have been jabbering about dresses all of the morning. I have been like a
      crazy man&mdash;I was all on fire this morning, too! O God, it is too
      cruel!

      &mdash;How long is this to continue, I want to know. Here it is afternoon
      and they are still chattering. Every time I have tried to compose my
      thoughts they have come back and begun chattering again. And so I can only
      pace about, and then rush out into the street&mdash;and wear myself sick.
      I call this simply monstrous. That my soul should be tied down to such
      vulgarity as this&mdash;is it not maddening? Here I am&mdash;with all my
      load of woe&mdash;at this fearful crisis! And I am to be shattered and
      wrecked and ruined by <i>this</i>! Just as long as they choose to sit
      there, just so long I am helpless. Was it for this that I have borne all
      the pain?

      to suffer and to choke in my rage.

      come out. Ah, you rich men! You who rule us, who own the treasures, the

      whole lifetime is to be trampled into nothingness for lack of what others
      spend upon one dress? Yes, of my whole lifetime! My whole lifetime! Give
      me but what another will spend upon one foolish gimcrack that he never

    <p>
      And of course the landlady was astonished. &ldquo;Why, Mr. Stirling, can't a
      body talk in a body's own room?&rdquo; Yes, a body can talk, but then other
      bodies have to move away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now she's going to speak to her sister about it. And here I sit, writhing
      and trembling. Oh my God, suppose I have to move! Oh merciful Father, have
      pity on me&mdash;I can't bear much of this! To go tramping around this hot
      and horrible city, to go into some new and perhaps yet more dirty place!
      And oh, the agony, the shame&mdash;suppose <i>that</i> will not do, and I
      have to keep on searching! Dragging this fearful burden with me! And I
      have only eighteen dollars left!

      And now it is all settled. A body has to talk in a body's own room, and a
      body's nose has to turn up with indignation as a body announces the fact.
      And so here I sit, waiting for the expressman to come for my trunk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now that it is over it does not seem so bad. I am like a snail&mdash;once
      back in my shell, I do not care what happens. I have given up trying to
      write The Captive, and so nothing bothers me any more.&mdash;I have
      forgotten all about it now, it is years behind me.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I have seen it all; I can get it back in good time. I do not fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have rolled up a little bundle, a tooth-brush and some manuscripts
      principally; and I send the rest to a friend's house. I have had an
      inspiration. Why should I stay in this hot and steaming place?&mdash;Why
      should I be &ldquo;barricaded evermore within the walls of cities?&rdquo; <i>Ich will
      ins Land!</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Why did I not think of this in the beginning? I am going now to see the
      springtime!&mdash;&ldquo;the only pretty ring time, when birds do sing&mdash;hey
      ding-a-ding!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That was a real idea. I do not know where I am going; but I will walk and
      get somewhere&mdash;there will be woods. I'll sleep in hay-ricks if it
      can't be managed any other way.

      then, my money is going! I must find some sort of a hut&mdash;a
      tumble-down house, an old barn&mdash;anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      I shall trudge one more day's journey. Then I think I shall be far enough
      from New York.

      &mdash;I passed a tramp to-day; and while we walked together I composed an
      address:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My brother&mdash;for are we not brothers, thou and I?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have we not fled from the sleek man, thou and I? And is it not we alone
      that know Truth?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thy clothing is ragged, and there is hunger in thine eyes; it is so also
      with me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is thy fate to wander; it is my fate to wander too. And with restless
      eyes to look out upon the world, to meet with distrust from men.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet not for that am I sad, nay, not for that, but for a deeper sorrow;
      because I was sent out into the world with a curse upon me, because I was
      sent out into the world a Drunkard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yea, so it is, my brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that for which I thirst is not easy to find; and when I have found it
      I am not content, but must seek more; and so I have only desolation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who laid this curse upon us, my brother?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That we should dwell in sorrow and unrest?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That no man should heed our voice, and that we should grow weak and
      faint?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That we should die, and be forgotten&mdash;thou and I?

      I have walked another day. I am beginning to get away from the suburban
      towns, and into the real country. I knew that it would cost me a good deal
      to go to a hotel last night, and it was warm, so I slept in a hay-stack!
      It was quite an adventure. Now I've got my pockets stuffed full of rolls,
      Benjamin Franklin style.
    </p>
    <p>
      &mdash;My mind is like the ocean after a storm.
    </p>
    <p>
      The great waves come rolling over it still; it is all restless, tossing.
      But it is sinking, sinking to rest!&mdash;Heaven grant that I may find my
      place of refuge before it is quite calm.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is everything or nothing with me; I am made that way. Either I give
      every instant of my time, every thought, every effort to my work, or else
      I close up like a flower and wait. I can not write poetry and hunt a
      lodging too.
    </p>
    <p>
      So I am waiting&mdash;waiting.&mdash;

    <p>
      I began inquiring to-day&mdash;a shanty, a barn&mdash;anything. Every one
      thinks it necessary to be very much puzzled about what I want it for. My
      clothes are still fairly respectable, and so they tell me about pretty
      summer cottages&mdash;only so much per month!

      I have been tramping on and on for two more days. I do not believe I shall
      ever find what I want. Nothing but one old musty place in ruins, so far!
      And my money is going, and I am wild with anxiety! I am almost tempted to
      turn back to the ruin.

      I am sitting in a room in a dirty hotel. It was raining to-day and I had
      to come here. I shall probably have to pay fifty cents too. I won't stay
      to breakfast.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh what will I do if my money gives out? I saw a cottage to-day, that a
      man said I could have for ten dollars a month. I was tempted to spend
      nearly all I had and take it, and live on bread and water. I am desperate.

    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps maybe you'd like 'Oaklands,'&rdquo; said the farmer, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oaklands&rdquo; turned out to be the home of a millionaire &ldquo;dry-goods man&rdquo; who
      was in Europe. I did not want &ldquo;Oaklands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know of anything else,&rdquo; said the farmer, scratching his head.
      Then he added with a grin, &ldquo;unless it be the cook-house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the cook-house?&rdquo; I asked, suspiciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it's a kind of a little place they've got 'way out in the woods,&rdquo;
       said the farmer. &ldquo;It's where they goes when they goes picnicking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My heart gave a jump. &ldquo;What sort of a place?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They've got a big platform chiefly, where they put up a tent. The
      cook-house ain't nothin' but a little two by four shanty, with a big stove
      in it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How big is it?&rdquo; I cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's about half o' this here room, I reckon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      (&ldquo;This here room&rdquo; was about six of my rooms in New York!)
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And where is it?&rdquo; I cried. &ldquo;How can I get there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you don't want to go to no sech place ez that!&rdquo; said the farmer.
      &ldquo;There ain't no bed nor nothin' in it! An' it's two mile out there in the
      woods!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Let anybody imagine how my heart was going! &ldquo;Who can show it to me?&rdquo; I
      panted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I'm the man that's in charge of it; but I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And can you rent it to me for a month?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I don't know any reason why I can't rent it to you for a year&mdash;only
      it ain't worth nothin', an'&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then rent it to me! The less it is worth the better it will suit me. But
      come, show me where it is!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon I can show you,&rdquo; said the man, looking perplexed. &ldquo;But what in
      the world do you want to go into that lonesome place for? Why, boy, nobody
      goes there in a month! An' what you goin' to do for somethin' to eat, an'
      some place to sleep, an'&mdash;&rdquo;

      I managed to get him started at last. And now, oh just look at me! I've
      been roaming around staring at it&mdash;inside and outside. The gods love
      me after all.
    </p>
    <p>
      The infinite relief that it is! The infinite exultation that it is! And
      all to myself&mdash;not a soul near me! And out in the woods! <i>And mine
      for a month!</i> Oh blessed 'cello player that moved away; blessed
      landlady's sister that talked&mdash;!
    </p>
    <p>
      And oh blessed cook-house! We will make thee a consecrated cook-house
      before we get through&mdash;we will! We will cook a dish in thee that will
      warm the hearts of a goodly company&mdash;oh blessed cook-house!

      The &ldquo;cook-house&rdquo; is about ten feet square. It is about one-third stove,
      now covered with a newspaper and serving as a table. Besides that there is
      one chair, for which I have just improvised a leg, with the help of my
      knife.
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides the knife I have a fork, a plate, a cup, and a spoon&mdash;borrowed
      from the farmer. I have a blanket and a bed consisting of an old carriage
      robe, rented from the farmer. I have a lamp and a kerosene-can&mdash;ditto.
      I have a frying-pan&mdash;ditto. But I haven't my little oil-stove, so I
      fear I shall eat mostly cold things. I have a pail of milk, a loaf of
      bread, a ginger-cake, some butter, some eggs, some bacon, some apples and
      some radishes; also a tooth-brush, a comb, a change of clothing, two
      handkerchiefs, some pencils and paper, Prometheus Bound, Prometheus
      Unbound, Samson Agonistes, faith, hope, and charity!

      I have scooped myself out a bathtub below the spring. I forgot towels in
      my list of necessaries! I fear it will be inconvenient on rainy days. I am
      like a child with a new toy, in my wonderful home. I was too excited to
      think of working. I fried an egg over a little fire, and then I roamed all
      about the woods. I don't remember ever having been so happy before. I had
      forgotten there was anything beautiful in the world.&mdash;

      house in the woods! I have just had it before my eyes&mdash;and I laughed
      with delight like a boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      It will be a fine big house&mdash;it will cost about fifty dollars; and
      there will be a table and a chair, and a cot, and such things. It will
      stand by a lake, a wild lake far out in the mountains! I have vowed to
      find a lake at least five miles from anything; and once a week I will have
      somebody bring me provisions.

      I have done nothing for two days but wander around and stare at things. It
      is all gone, every gleam of it! And I can not bring it back&mdash;I know
      not what to do, where to turn. I stopped in one of the hardest parts of
      the whole thing&mdash;in the very midst of it; and how in the world am I
      to begin? I walk around, I sit down, I get up again; I try to put my
      thoughts upon it, I bring them back again and again. But I can not do it&mdash;I
      have let every thread of it go. What has tramping over the country and
      delight in houses got to do with my work?
    </p>
    <p>
      I have nothing to write&mdash;the whole thing is a blank to me. And here I
      am, eating up my provisions!&mdash;This shows me what I am&mdash;what a
      child.
    </p>
    <p>
      &mdash;But how am I to get up on those fearful heights again? How am I to
      take the first step toward those fearful heights again? I cry that all

      It is better than an orchestra. To be able to stretch your arms! To have a

      do what you please!&mdash;to be free from all men, and the thought of all
      men!
    </p>
    <p>
      And to hear your own poetry aloud!&mdash;I cried out to-day that I would
      go back and do the whole of The Captive over again, so that I could hear
      it out loud. It made me quite wild yesterday when I first realized that I
      was <i>alone</i>!

      I ate a raw egg this morning. For yesterday I let the fire go out five
      times, and gave up my breakfast rather than start a sixth.
    </p>
    <p>
      I wanted to save time&mdash;I thought it would be egg just the same; but I
      record it for future generations of poets, that the experiment is not a
      success. You taste raw egg all day.
    </p>

      I shall have them all hard-boiled in the farmhouse after this.

      &mdash;There is always a new height, but there are not always new words.
      My verse grows more and more incoherent, and more and more daring. I can

      I have worn a path in the woods, deep and wide, pacing back and forth,
      back and forth, all day. Any one who saw me would think that I was mad.
      Fighting&mdash;fighting&mdash;all the time fighting! Sometimes I run&mdash;sometimes
      I don't know what I do. Last night I know that it grew dark, and that I
      was still lying flat on the dead leaves, striking my hands, that were numb
      with excitement. I was too weak to move&mdash;but I remember panting out,
      &ldquo;There is nothing like that in <i>King Lear</i>!&rdquo;

      To-day you may imagine me frantically throwing stones at a squirrel. I
      said: &ldquo;If I get him I won't have to go to the farmhouse to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I had had nothing to eat but bread and apples for two meals, and I
      couldn't stand that again.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had fried squirrel and fried apples for supper. It was a very curious
      repast.
    </p>
    <p>
      And I was hungry, and I ate too much! That made me wild, of course, and I

      I get up every morning like&mdash;like the sun! I overflow with laughter&mdash;nothing
      frightens me now. I never knew what was the matter with me before&mdash;it
      was simply that I could not fight as I chose. If ever I go back again to
      have my soul pent up in the cities of men!
    </p>
    <p>
      I am full of it&mdash;full of it! I grapple with it all the day, I can not
      get enough of it. I do crazy things.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the harder it is the faster I go! This thing has been my torturing&mdash;it
      has made me fight and live. That is really the truth.

    <p>
      I was not ill&mdash;my relief was so great. I was only happy. I lay back
      and closed my eyes. I have born my child.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is done! It is done! I realize it, and then I am like a crazy person. I

      is melted with the woe of them&mdash;but I can do them anywhere&mdash;anyhow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &mdash;And a sudden wild longing has come over me for the city. I must

      I fought a fight with myself yesterday, and won it. The last of my

      on the train! I was that hungry for the goal! But I am still here&mdash;doing
      the last scene. I shall stay until it is done. I can not stay after that.

    <p>
      Five in the afternoon! And the wind was howling in turret and tree, and
      all the forest was an organ chant. So I packed up my belongings, and laid
      my poem in next to my heart&mdash;the last words written: &ldquo;It is done!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And I went out and stood and gazed at my little home. Farewell, farewell,
      little home! Perhaps I shall never see you again; but ever you will live
      in my fancy as my heaven upon earth. They built thee for picnic parties!
      And I wonder what proud prince had built for his pleasures&mdash;the
      Garden of Gethsemane!

    </p>
    <p>
      And now I go forth like a bridegroom out of my chamber, rejoicing as a
      strong man to run a race. And all the world dances around me, and I
      stretch out my arms and sing!
    </p>
    <p>
      Come, come, my foes, where are ye now? What foes shall I be afraid of now!
      Is it the world and its trials? Come!
    </p>

    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />

    <p>
      There is nothing so commonplace that it does not sing to me. I walk with a
      springing step, I laugh, I exult. Birds, flowers, men&mdash;I love them
      all; I get into the train, and the going of it is drunkenness. I have won!
      I have won!
    </p>
    <p>
      I go back to the world. Come, world! I have but four dollars left&mdash;four
      dollars!&mdash;and The Captive!

    <p>
      It is not strange that a man should be made drunk with happiness by the
      writing of a tragedy! That is the great insincerity of the artist. &ldquo;That
      cry of agony!&mdash;what a triumph of genius was that my cry of agony!&rdquo;

      &mdash;It is not the sorrow, it is the struggle; so I read the tragedy.
      This man is dead, but God lives, and Art lives.
    </p>
    <p>
      I will go back, I will do anything now&mdash;I will empty ash-cans, and
      find it a joy. The book is done&mdash;safe in next to my heart!&mdash;And
      now it will be printed, and not fire nor earthquake can destroy it after
      that. Free! Free!

    </p>
    <p>
      But back there, coming out of the woods, I shouted&mdash;and not
      commonplaces either!

      SEEKING A PUBLISHER
    </h3>
    <p>
      July 8th.
    </p>
    <p>
      To-day I took it to the publisher's!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      I had been pondering for a week who were the best publishers. To-day I
      hardly had the courage to go in&mdash;I know nothing about such things&mdash;and
      my hands shook so I could hardly hold the package.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      I asked to see the manager. I told him I had a manuscript to submit. He
      looked at me&mdash;I guess I must look rather seedy. &ldquo;What sort of a
      manuscript?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;A blank verse drama!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he took it and glanced over it. &ldquo;Blank verse dramas are difficult
      things to publish,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had best read it, I think,&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;you will find it worth
      while.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, if you wish,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;we always read everything that is
      offered to us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How soon shall you be able to let me know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, in a week or ten days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      And then I went out&mdash;shuddering with excitement. A week or ten days!
      Well&mdash;I can wait. I have done all <i>my</i> duty, at any rate.
    </p>

      July 9th.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have certainly played a bold game with my poem! At the publisher's at
      last&mdash;and I, having paid my room-rent, have just a dollar in my
      pocket!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      I have been tramping about all day to-day, looking for some work. I don't
      care what it is&mdash;I can do anything to keep alive for a week or ten
      days.&mdash;I wonder if they will advance me some money at once.
    </p>

    </p>

    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      They all stare at me suspiciously. I think some of the wildness of the
      woods must still hang about me.&mdash;Anyway, I walk along on air, I fear
      nothing. I could hug all the passers-by. My book is at the publisher's! I
      could beg, I think, if I had to, and do it serenely, exultingly. I have
      only a dollar&mdash;but have I not all the stars?
    </p>
    <p>

      I was thinking to-day about Carlyle, and that ghastly accident to his
      manuscript. Let others blame Carlyle for his sins&mdash;for those days of
      agony and horror I forgive him all things, and love him.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have the original manuscript of The Captive put safely away. If that
      poem were destroyed it would kill me. I can think of anything else in the
      world but such a thing as that.

    <p>
      What will they write me about it? I picture to myself all the emotions of
      a publisher when he discovers a poem like that! Ah yes, good publisher, I
      have scanned your lists for many months back; but you have published
      nothing like The Captive.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then I shall taste my first drop of success.
    </p>
    <p>
      &mdash;I do not want it for myself&mdash;it is not that&mdash;I want it
      for the book! I want people to love it&mdash;I want it to stir their
      souls! I want brothers and friends and lovers in that great glory of mine!
      That is why I want all the world to shake with it.

      thinking where I should live, and what I should do.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first thing I shall do is to get somebody to teach me music. And then
      all the concerts that I long for! How long has it been since I have heard

      people stuffing themselves with food&mdash;the dirt and the grease and the
      stench and the endless hideous drudgery! And I five days out of the
      springing forest and the ecstasy of inspiration!&mdash;Truly, it is a
      thing to put one's glory to a test! But I hardly feel it&mdash;I walk on
      air&mdash;deep back in my soul there is an organ song, I hear it all day,
      all day!
    </p>
    <p>
      How soon will they write? I fly up-stairs each night, looking for a
      letter. Hurry up! Hurry up!

      The book! The book! I go thinking about it&mdash;when I come home I throw
      myself down on the bed and laugh with suppressed excitement. I think all
      day&mdash;they are reading it now, perhaps! Ah, my book! And perhaps I'll
      find somebody at home there to see me about it to-night!
    </p>
    <p>
      I look at the reviews&mdash;I am interested in all the books of the day
      now&mdash;because The Captive is going to be among them! How will it seem
      to see it there, in big letters?

      help me to my peace when I am out there in the woods again&mdash;and it
      will not be that the newspapers have been talking about me, and that the
      dames of high society have asked me to their tea-parties. But there are
      one or two men in this world that I should like to know. Perhaps as the
      author of a book that is known it would be possible.

      The horror of that awful &ldquo;eating-joint&rdquo; grows on me every hour. I could
      not bear it much more&mdash;physically it makes me ill, and no amount of
      enthusiasm can make that better. I will not sell a second more of my time
      than I have to. I made up my mind that I would give up the place at the
      end of the week. The money will do me for another week after that, and by
      that time I will surely have heard from the publishers.

    </p>
    <p>
      I treated myself to a long holiday this afternoon. I went up to the park,
      and walked and walked. Everything was in a tumult within me&mdash;I was
      clear of that last prison. And all the excitement and the power of that
      poem are still in me. I am restless, all on fire, stern, hungry, like a
      wind-storm. Come not near me unless you wish for truth! Come not near me
      if you fear the gods!
    </p>
    <p>
      To-day my thoughts went surging into the future. I shall have money!&mdash;I
      shall be free!&mdash;And what shall I do next? I counted up what I might
      have&mdash;even a slight success for the book would mean a fortune such as
      turned my head to think of. What would I do?
    </p>
    <p>
      My mind pounced upon a new work&mdash;a work that I have dreamed of often.
      Would it be my next work? I thought&mdash;would I be able&mdash;would I
      dare? It is a grand thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went on, and got to thinking of it; I almost forgot that I was not still
      in the woods. What a sweeping thing I see it!
    </p>
    <p>
      The American! It would have to be a three-volume novel, I fear&mdash;it
      would be as huge as Les Misérables!
    </p>
    <p>
      It is the Civil War! I am haunted by that fearful struggle. Is there
      anything more fearful in history, any more tremendous effort of the human
      spirit? And so far it has not made one great poem, one great drama, one
      great novel!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the furnace-fire in which this land was forged&mdash;this land
      which holds in its womb the future of the world&mdash;this land that is to
      give laws to the nations and teach mankind its destiny. I search the ages,
      and I find no struggle so fraught with meaning, with the woe and the
      terror and the agony of a desperate hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      It must be all put into an art-work, I say! There is no theme that could
      thrill the men of this country more, that could lift them more, that could
      do more to make their hearts throb with pride. We sent all the best that
      we had&mdash;armies and armies of them&mdash;and they toiled and suffered,
      they rotted upon a thousand fields of horror. And their souls cry out to
      me, that it must not be for naught, that the fearful consecration must not
      be for naught.
    </p>
    <p>
      The world is filled with historical fiction; it is the cant and the sham
      of the hour.&mdash;Bah!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      &mdash;This is what I long to do; to take the agony of that struggle and
      live it and forge it into an art-work; to put upon a canvas the soul of
      it; to put it there, living and terrible, that the men of this land might
      know the heritage that is come down to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would take years of toil, it would take money, too&mdash;I should have
      to go down there. But some day I shall do it!
    </p>
    <p>
      I saw some of it to-day, and it made my blood go!
    </p>
    <p>
      I saw a poet, young, sensitive, throbbing at the old, old wrong, at the
      black shame of our history; I saw him drawn into that fearful whirlpool of
      blood and passion, driven mad with the pain and the horror of it; and I
      saw him drilled and hammered to a grim savageness, saw him fighting, day
      by day, with his spirit, forging it into an iron sword of war. He was
      haggard and hollow-eyed, hard, ruthless, desperate. He saw into the
      future, he saw the land he loved, the land he dreamed of&mdash;the Union!
      She stretched out her arms to him; she cried with the voices of unborn
      ages, she wrung her hands in the agony of her despair. And for her his
      heart beat, for her he was a madman, for her he marched in sun and in
      snow, for her he was torn and slashed, for her he waded through fields of
      slaughter. Of her he dreamed and sung&mdash;sung to the camps in the
      night-time, till armies were thrilled with his singing.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the thing of which he sang, the gaunt, grim poet: There is a
      monster, huge beyond thought, terrible, all-destroying; the name of it is
      Rebellion, and the end of it is Death! Day by day you grapple with it, day
      by day you hammer it, day by day you crush it. Down with it, down with it!
      Finish it!
    </p>
    <p>
      I heard that as a battle-cry: &ldquo;Finish it!&rdquo; I saw a man, wild and
      war-frenzied, riding a war-frenzied horse; he rode at the head of a
      squadron, bare-headed, sword in hand, demon-like&mdash;thundering
      down-hill upon a mass of men, stabbing, slashing, trampling, scattering!
      Above the roar of it all I heard his cry: &ldquo;Finish it! Finish it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And afterward he staggered from his horse and knelt by the men he had
      killed, and wept.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      &mdash;I saw him again. It was when the man of the hour had come at last;
      when the monster had met his master; when, day by day, they hammered it,
      the fire-spitting, death-dealing monster; when they closed with it in
      death-grapple in a tangled wilderness, where armies fought like demons in
      the dark, and the wounded were burned by the thousands. I saw companies of
      fainting, starving, agonized men, retreating, still battling, day by day;
      and I saw the wild horseman galloping on their track, slashing, trampling&mdash;and
      still with the battle-yell: &ldquo;Finish it! Finish it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      I saw him yet a third time. It was done, it was finished; and he lay
      wounded in a dark room, listening. Outside in the streets of Washington a
      great endless army marched by, the army of victory, of salvation; and the
      old war-flags waved, and the old war-songs echoed, and he heard the
      trampling of ten thousand feet&mdash;the rumbling of the old cannon&mdash;and
      the ocean-roaring of the vast throngs of men! A wild delirium of victory
      throbbed in his soul,&mdash;burned him up, as he lay there alone, dying of
      his passion and his wounds. Born of the joy that throbbed in the air about
      him, born of the waving banners and the clashing trumpets and the
      trampling hosts and the shouting millions&mdash;a figure loomed up before
      him&mdash;a figure with eyes of flame and a form that towered like the
      mountains&mdash;with arms outstretched in rapture and robes that touched
      the corn-fields as she sped&mdash;angel, prophetess, goddess!&mdash;Liberty!

    <p>
      Nervous, impatient&mdash;it is so that I have lived. Never to waste an
      instant has been my passion. I have struggled, watched, fought for a
      minute. If ever I were held back or kept idle it drove me wild, and I
      burst through everything. It has always been a torture to me not to be
      thinking something.
    </p>
    <p>
      But less of that torture than I have now, I think I never had; it seems as
      if I had won the mastery&mdash;I mind nothing any more. I walk upon the
      air, and I never tire. Thoughts&mdash;endless thoughts&mdash;come to me
      without ever the asking; nothing disturbs me, nothing hinders me&mdash;I

      learned that I can do what I will! I have seen the infinite heights that
      lie beyond&mdash;oh, let me not fail! The hopes of unborn generations are

    <p>
      I was getting down pretty close to the limit again, but I got something to
      do to-day. I had to take what I could find; it is what would be called a
      good position, I suppose; I am in a wholesale-paper store. I get twelve
      dollars, and that is quite something.
    </p>

      The business of the will is to face the things that come&mdash;not any
      other things. Now I have to drill and discipline myself anew, to learn to
      save my soul alive in a wholesale-paper store!
    </p>
    <p>
      It is a great, dingy place, full of chaffering, hungry-looking men. They
      are all desperately serious; it is a great &ldquo;business house,&rdquo; I believe;
      the very atmosphere of it is deadly poison.
    </p>
    <p>
      &mdash;Oh bald-headed, grim-visaged senior-partner, that didst gaze at me
      over black-rimmed spectacles&mdash;so I have &ldquo;an opportunity to rise,&rdquo;
       have I?
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes,&mdash;I shall rise upon wings of a sapphire sheen, and toss myself up
      in the wind and shake down showers of golden light into thy wondering
      eyes, oh bald-headed, grim-visaged senior-partner!

      them in a few days, and then I shall go at the Greek.

      Something strange flashed over me to-day, something that sent a shudder
      through me; I have done a strange thing to myself this summer, not in
      metaphor, but in fact. I have seen a ghost; I have drunk a potion; I have
      gazed upon a nymph; I have made myself mad!

      Nothing satisfies me as it used to,&mdash;I am restless, hungry, ill at

      anything, dare anything. Yes, so I can&mdash;if I can strive! Put me out
      there alone, and set me a task, and I will do it though it kill me. But
      how can I conquer when I can not strive?
    </p>
    <p>
      Here I am, tied! I am tied&mdash;not hand and foot&mdash;but tied in soul.
      Tied in time! Tied in attention! How can I be anything but beaten and
      wretched? How can I expect anything but defeat and ruin? A song comes to
      me, it calls me&mdash;and I can not go! I must stare at it and watch it
      leave me!&mdash;How can that not drive me wild?
    </p>
    <p>
      The great wings of my soul begin to beat&mdash;I go up, I am wild for the
      air,&mdash;and then suddenly I am struck back by the hideous impertinences
      of the wholesale-paper business! How can I endure such things as that&mdash;how
      can I <i>conquer</i> Why, it is like the clashing in my ears of twenty

      I will make no compromises; I have sworn a vow against idle words&mdash;they

      This is a wholesale-paper house, and the three partners who run it call

      lives in wholesale-paper,&mdash;they talk it&mdash;they dream it&mdash;they
      plan it&mdash;they have no hope in the world except to find people to buy
      wholesale-paper! And the manager&mdash;keen and hungry&mdash;he is
      planning to be a wholesale-paper man himself. And here are twenty-five men
      and youths apparently having but one virtue in the world, the possibility
      of consecrating their souls to wholesale-paper!
    </p>
    <p>
      What they make is useful, it may even be sublime&mdash;in which way the
      business is unique. But none of these men ever thinks of that&mdash;they
      would be just as absorbed in the business if it were wholesale bonnets.
      None of them has the least care in the world about books. And these men
      who come here to buy the paper&mdash;are <i>they</i> any better? Or is

      To-day I made a resolution, that I must stop this chafing, this panting,
      this beating my wings to pieces. A man's inspiration must be under his
      control, to stop it, as well as to start it. I can not write or dream
      poetry while I am in this slavery, and somehow I have to realize it. When
      I go home I will get to some work, and not wander around hungering.
    </p>
    <p>
      After my glimpse of the forest it is frightful to be penned in this
      steaming city. To have to work in an office all day&mdash;sometimes it
      makes me reel. And then at night too, when I try to read, the room gets
      suffocating.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then I go out among the tenement-house crowds, carrying my little
      note-book. I stop at a lamp-post and look at a couple of words and then
      walk on and learn them! So I go for hours.

      not seem to us that the publication of this poem would be a venture in
      which we could engage with profit. At the same time, however, we have been

      I saw the manager of the firm. He meant to be very kind, that is the first

      &ldquo;Now, Mr. Stirling,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you know a publishing house is always on
      the lookout for the new man. That is why I wanted to have the pleasure of
      meeting you. It is evident to me that you have literary talent of no
      common kind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      (I bow.)
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish that I could tell you that we could consider The Captive an
      available piece of writing; I have read it myself with the greatest care.
      But you must know, Mr. Stirling, that it is an exceedingly <i>difficult</i>
      piece of work; I mean difficult from a publisher's point of view. There is
      very little demand for poetry nowadays&mdash;a publisher generally brings
      out at a loss even the poems that make a reputation for their authors.
      Whether you are aware of that I don't know, but it is true; and I think of
      all kinds of poetry a blank verse tragedy is the most to be shunned.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      (Here a pause. I have never any tongue when I am with men.)
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What I want to talk to you about, Mr. Stirling, is the work which you
      contemplate in the future. As I said, I was interested at once in this
      work; I should like very much indeed to advise you and to be of any
      assistance to you that I can. I should like very much to know what your
      plans are. I should like very much to see anything that you might write.
      Are you contemplating anything just at present?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not just at present.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not? Don't you think that you might find it possible to produce something
      just a little more in accordance with the public taste? Don't you think,
      for instance, that you might possibly write a novel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      (Some hesitation.) &ldquo;I have thought of a novel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! And might I ask&mdash;would it be a character study?&mdash;or perhaps
      historical?&mdash;or&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be historical.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! And of what period?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Civil War.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      (A great look of satisfaction.) &ldquo;Dear me! Why, that is very interesting
      indeed, Mr. Stirling! I should like to see such a work from your pen. And
      are you thinking of completing it soon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      (General discomfort on my part.) &ldquo;I had never thought of the time exactly.
      I had feared it would take a great many years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      (Perplexity.) &ldquo;Oh, pshaw!&mdash;still, of course, that is the way all
      great work is done. Yes, one has to obey one's own inspiration. I
      understand perfectly how he can not adjust himself to the market. I have
      seen too often how disastrous such attempts are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      (More courteous platitudes, I assenting. Then at last, weary&mdash;)
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't think, then, that you will be able to undertake The Captive?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Mr. Stirling, I really do not think we can. You understand, of
      course, if I take this work to the firm I have to tell them I think it
      will sell; and that I can not honestly do. You know that a publishing
      house is just as much limited as any other business firm&mdash;it can not
      afford to publish books that the trade does not want. And this is an
      especially unusual sort of thing, it is by no means easy to appreciate&mdash;you
      must be aware of that yourself, Mr. Stirling. You see when I read a
      manuscript I have to keep constantly before my mind the thought of how it
      is going to affect the public&mdash;a very different thing from my own
      judgment, of course. From the former standpoint I believe there are things
      in The Captive that would meet with a reception not satisfactory to either
      of us, Mr. Stirling.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      (Perplexity on my part.) &ldquo;You'll have to explain that to me, I fear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why&mdash;but the explaining of that would be to offer you my opinion
      about the book&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should be very pleased to hear it. Your reason for declining it, then,
      is not altogether that it is a blank-verse drama?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not altogether, Mr. Stirling. It's a little difficult for me to tell you
      about these things, you know. I understand that the book must have meant a
      great deal to you, and so I am naturally diffident. But if you will pardon
      my saying so, it seems to me that the book&mdash;it is obviously, of
      course, the work of a young man&mdash;it is very emotional, it strives to
      very high altitudes. I will not say that it is exaggerated, but&mdash;the
      last part particularly&mdash;it seems to me that you are writing in too
      high a key, that your voice is strained.&rdquo; (An uncomfortable pause.) &ldquo;Of
      course, now, that is but my opinion. It will not seem of any value to you,
      perhaps, but while I read it I could not get away from the fact that it
      was not altogether natural. It seemed hysterical and overwrought in places&mdash;it
      gives the effect of crudeness. It is rather hard, you know, to expect a
      man who sits at a desk all day to follow you in such very strenuous
      flights.&rdquo; (A slight laugh.)
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mind you it is not that I do not appreciate high qualities, Mr. Stirling,
      it is merely that it seemed to me that if it were toned down somewhat it
      would be better&mdash;you know such things strike different people in
      different ways; you do not find it easy to believe that it would affect
      men so&mdash;but I am pretty sure that the impulse of the average critic

      I have told enough of that story, giving the conversation as literally as
      I can recall it. I am always a fool, the presence of other men overawes
      me; I sit meek and take all that comes, and then make my escape. The great
      publishers' manager still thinks he impressed me with his wisdom&mdash;he
      has half an idea I'm going to &ldquo;tone down&rdquo; The Captive!

      I sat last night brooding over this thing till almost dawn. I could not
      bring myself to the thought of offering my work again to be judged by such
      people. I made up my mind to take a different course&mdash;I sat and wrote
      a long letter to a certain poet whom I love and honor. He is known as a
      critic&mdash;he will know. I told him the whole story, and asked him to
      read the poem.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was something that I had never thought about, the effect of The Captive
      upon commonplace people. I was so full of my own rapture&mdash;I made my
      audience out of my own fancy. And now these snuffy little men come peering
      at it!

      how I hate it! Such heart-sickening waiting&mdash;waiting!&mdash;and
      meanwhile that intolerable treadmill! It drives me wild! I am so full of
      life, of passion; and to be dragged back&mdash;and back&mdash;and stamped
      on! Each day I feel myself weaker; each day my power and my joy are going.
      Let me go&mdash;let me go!

      To-day I took myself off in a corner. I said: &ldquo;Am I not here, have I not
      this thing to <i>do</i>? The power that I have in my soul&mdash;it is to
      be used for the doing of <i>this</i>; if I am to save my soul, it must be
      by the doing of <i>this</i>! And I am a fool that I do not face the fact.
      I shall be free some day&mdash;that I know&mdash;I have only to bide my
      time and wait. Meanwhile I am to stay here&mdash;or until I have money
      enough; and now I will turn my soul to iron, and do it! I am going to
      study what I can in this place, and at night I am going to speed home and
      get into a book. I will never stop again, and never give up&mdash;and
      above all never think, and never feel! I will get books of fact to read&mdash;I
      will read histories, and no more poetry. I will read Motley, and Parkman,
      and Prescott, and Gibbon, and Macaulay.&mdash;Macaulay will not afflict me
      with wild yearnings, I guess.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &mdash;Is there any author in the world more vulgar than Macaulay?&mdash;unless
      it be Gibbon. Or possibly Chesterfield.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have heard Chesterfield's letters referred to as a &ldquo;school for

      I have been reading George Moore's Evelyn Innes for the last two days. He
      is striving toward deeper things; but the mark of the beast is in the
      fiber.
    </p>
    <p>
      The spiritual struggles of a young lady with two sloppy lovers at once! Of
      a young and beautiful girl whose first walk on the street with a baronet
      is a &ldquo;temptation.&rdquo; And who turns nun at last and worships the Holy Virgin,
      in order to forget her nastiness! A Gallicized novelist ought to deal with
      Gallic characters. While I was reading Evelyn Innes, I could never get
      away from the impression that I was reading the career of a chambermaid.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the whole story hinges upon the fact that a woman can not sing the
      sacred ecstasy of Tristan and Isolde without being a harlot!

      I read the Confessions of a Young Man, and I felt the vigor of it, and the
      daring; but it was a very cheap kind of daring. The fundamental laws of
      life are occasionally enunciated by commonplace people, and that gives an
      opportunity to be startling. But I leave it for small boys to gape at such
      fireworks; my interest is in the stars.
    </p>
    <p>
      The last chapter runs into absolute brutality. I am accustomed to say that
      Gautier is a ruffian author, but if there is any ruffianism in Gautier
      more savage than that sentiment about the &ldquo;skinful of champagne,&rdquo; I do not
      know where to find it.
    </p>
    <p>
      About such stuff as that I would say that it makes me sick, but it is not
      worth that&mdash;it simply makes me tired. One would not call it impudent,
      because it is so silly&mdash;it is the driveling of a fool. He will get me
      off in a corner now, will he, and probe my soul? &ldquo;Out with it!&mdash;Why
      not confess that you'd like to live a life of dissipation if you only had
      the money!&rdquo; Why, you poor fool, before I would live such a life, I'd have
      my eyes torn out, and my ears torn off, and my fingers, and my hands, and
      my feet. &ldquo;Why not confess the wild joys of getting drunk on champagne!&rdquo;
       Poor fool, I have never tasted champagne.

      I never was drunk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &mdash;And yet I know something about drunkenness. I once buried a
      drunkard. He was my father. He died in a delirium.

      do not philosophize about the crowd. But I mean the artists. I was looking
      at a picture of Musset the other day; it was a noble face&mdash;the face
      of a man; and in the face of a man I read dignity and power&mdash;high
      things that I love and bow before. Here are lips,&mdash;and lips are
      things that speak of beauty; here are eyes,&mdash;and eyes are things that
      seek the light. And now to gaze upon that face and say: &ldquo;This man lived in
      foulness; he was the slave of hateful lust&mdash;he died rotten, and
      sodden with drink.&rdquo;&mdash;I say that I do not find it easy.

    <p>
      I have nothing to do with any artist who has anything to do with sin&mdash;anything,
      one way or the other. If a man must still think about sin, let him go
      back, and let him go down,&mdash;let him be a Christian. Let him wrestle
      with his body, overcome himself, obey laws, and learn fear. To such men
      and to such ways I can only say: &ldquo;I have nothing to do with you.&rdquo; My life
      is for free men&mdash;my words are for free men&mdash;for men defying law
      and purged of fear, for men mad with righteousness. What right have foul
      men in the temple of my muse? The thought of them is insult to me&mdash;away
      with them&mdash;in their presence I will not speak of what I love. For I
      am a drunkard&mdash;yes, and I am drunk all night and all day! And I am a
      lover&mdash;a free lover&mdash;knowing no law and defying all restraint.
      And how can I say such things in the presence of foul men?
    </p>
    <p>
      Let not any man think that he can feel the love-clasp of my muse while he
      hides a satyr's body underneath his cloak. Free is my muse, and bold,
      fearing not the embrace of man, fearing not passion, nor the words of
      passion,&mdash;not the throbbing heart, nor the burning brow, nor the
      choking voice. But the warmth of her breath and the fire of her eyes, they
      were kindled at a shrine of which the beast does not know. Let not any man
      think that he can kiss the lips of my muse while his breath is tainted
      with the fumes of wine!

      An artist is a man with one pleasure&mdash;and it is not self-indulgence;
      an artist is a man with one virtue&mdash;and it is not self-restraint.
      Sweetly and simply will I and my muse take all temptation, knowing not
      that it tempts, and wondering at the clamor of men. I will eat and drink
      that I may be nourished, I will sleep that I may be rested, I will dress
      that I may be warm. When I go among men it shall be to speak the truth,
      and when I press a woman to my heart, it shall be that a man may be born
      into the world. There is but one sin that I know, and that is dulness;
      there is but one virtue, and that is fire. And for the rest, I love
      pleasure, and hold it sweetest and holiest of all the words I know; the
      guide-post of all righteousness is pleasure&mdash;which whoso learns to
      read may follow all his days.

      My &ldquo;room&rdquo; costs me seventy-five cents a week, and my food from a dollar
      and a half to two dollars. At the end of the seventh week I shall have
      over fifty dollars clear. I have made up my mind to give up the place at
      the end of that time. Twelve dollars is the most I ever earned, but I
      can't stand it longer than that.
    </p>
    <p>
      I shall be clear for nearly four months, and that will surely put me safe
      until I have found a publisher. I would go away into the country again,
      only I must have books. I have nothing to write now.

      &mdash;Oh the heat of this dreadful city; sometimes it takes all my

      comes I am panting, and can only shut my eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      If I am kept here long, I tell you I shall never, as long as I live, be as
      strong and keen as I might have been.
    </p>
    <p>
      So long as I was working, striving for an education, preparing myself, I
      could bear it. But now I have done all that I can do amid these
      surroundings. I cry out day and night, &ldquo;I have earned my freedom!&rdquo;

      He had no business to send me that answer! He had no business to send it!

    <p>
      All day&mdash;all day&mdash;I have but one thought in my mind&mdash;but
      one thought in my life! I am beset by it, I can not escape it. That
      horrible shame to which I am subjected!
    </p>
    <p>
      It turns all my life to gall! It beats down my enthusiasm, it jeers at my
      faith, it spits into the face of my unselfishness! I come home every night
      weak and worn and filled with despair, or else with a choking in my
      throat, and helpless, cruel rage in my soul. Never mind that I am going to
      be free&mdash;the wrong is that it should ever have been&mdash;it will
      stay with me all my days and turn all my life to gall! It will wreck all
      my visions, all my aspirations, my faith, my eagerness; the memory of it
      will sound like a mocking voice in my ears, a sneer!
    </p>
    <p>
      Day by day I strive and struggle and tear my-self to pieces, and sink back
      worn out; and don't you suppose that has any effect upon me? I can feel
      it. I see it plain as day, and shudder at it&mdash;I am being cowed! I am
      being tamed, subdued, overpowered; the thing is like a great cold hand
      that is laid upon me, pressing me down, smothering me! I know it&mdash;and
      I cry out and struggle as if in a nightmare; but it only presses the
      harder. Why, I was like a lion&mdash;restless&mdash;savage&mdash;all-devouring!
      Never-ceasing, eager, untamable&mdash;hungry for life, for experience, for
      power! I rushed through in days what others took months at&mdash;I watched
      every instant&mdash;I crowded hours into it.

    <p>
      &mdash;And now look at me! I crouch and whine&mdash;there is an endless
      moan in my soul. Can you break a man's spirit so that he never rises
      again? So that all his attempts to be what he was mock at him? So that he
      never <i>tries</i> any more? Look at those poor wretches you pass on the
      street&mdash;those peasants from Europe, from Russia! See the restless,
      shifting eyes, the cringing gait&mdash;<i>that</i> is what it is to be
      tamed!

      build new empires&mdash;new hopes, new virtues, new power; all that I was,
      and all that I sought to be! Ah, but you will not crush me&mdash;understand
      it well, you may beat me and kick me, you may starve me to death, but you
      will never overcome me, you will never tame me into one of the pack-horses
      of society! I will fight while I have a breath in me, while my heart has
      left one beat.

      A man was talking to me to-day about what I am doing. &ldquo;I should think you
      would try to get some work more congenial,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;some literary work.&rdquo;
       Yes!&mdash;I sell wholesale-paper, and that is bad enough; but at least I
      do not sell my character.
    </p>
    <p>
      I to enter into the literary business world! I to forsake my ideals and my
      standards&mdash;to learn to please the public and the men who make money

      I have been forcing myself to read Gibbon, but half of him was all I could
      stand. I think with astonishment of the reputation of this history, a bare
      recital of facts, without the least interest or importance, and a recital
      by the shallowest of men!
    </p>
    <p>
      The vulgarity of his character is more evident than ever since the
      repressed parts of his biography have appeared. It is comical. And this
      man, who has no more understanding of spirituality than a cow, to tell the
      story of the greatest movement of the soul of man in history!
    </p>
    <p>
      There is not one gleam of the Christian superstition left in me. I have
      nothing to fear from the sneers of Gibbon any more than I have from those
      of Voltaire; but I do not care to hear lectures on the steam-engine by a
      man who does not believe in steam.

    <p>
      &mdash;Some of these days&mdash;the last thing that I can see on the
      horizon of my future&mdash;I am going to write a tragedy called Jesus. The
      time is past, it seems to me, when an artist must leave alone the greatest
      art-theme of the ages.
    </p>
    <p>
      Is it not the greatest? Is there any story in history more sublime than
      the story of this man? A humble, ignorant peasant he was, and out of the
      faith of his soul he made the future of the world for centuries! It is a
      thing that makes your brain reel.
    </p>
    <p>
      I write it casually, but I have shuddered over it far into the deep, deep
      night. I have dreamed of two acts&mdash;one of them Gethsemane, and the
      other Calvary.&mdash;Poor fool, perhaps I shall never write them!

      I have burrowed into that soul, seeking out the truths of it; the truths,
      as distinguished from the ten thousand fancies of men. When I write that
      drama I shall deal with those truths.
    </p>
    <p>
      The climax of the scene in the garden of Gethsemane will be a vision in
      which looms up before him the whole history of Christianity; and that will
      be the last agony. It will be then that he sweats blood.
    </p>
    <p>
      That will be something, I think.

      &ldquo;We have this same quality in ninety-pound paper at four sixty-nine!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Throughout all this thing it seemed to me that when I came out I should no
      longer have a soul. But it is not so; I shall still keep at it grimly.

    <p>
      And now to-day I make my plans. I must keep near a library; but I shall
      hunt out a room uptown. There I can be near the Park, and I shall suffer a
      little less from these hideous noises. I shall go over there and spend
      every day&mdash;find out some place where there are not too many
      nurse-girls!
    </p>
    <p>
      I can not begin any other book; I must stand or fall by The Captive. I
      shall be a &ldquo;homo unius libri&rdquo;!
    </p>
    <p>
      But I can not attempt to write again&mdash;ever&mdash;in these
      circumstances. It is not that my force is spent&mdash;I am only at the
      beginning of my life, I see everything in the future. But I could not
      wrestle with these outside things again&mdash;it took all my courage and
      all my strength to do it once.

      There is no reason why I should worry about that. I have fifty-six

      shall have found some one to love my book by that time!

    <p>
      A slight preliminary, of course. I spent a ghastly day hunting for a room.
      I found one in a sufficiently dirty and cheap place, and then I spent
      another hour finding a man who would take my trunk for a quarter. Having
      succeeded in that, I walked up there to save five cents; and when the
      trunk came the driver tried to charge me fifty cents!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Picture me haggling and arguing on the steps&mdash;&ldquo;Didn't know it was so
      far&mdash;Man didn't understand&rdquo;&mdash;God knows what else! And then he
      tries to carry off the trunk&mdash;and I rushing behind, looking for a
      policeman! Again more arguing, and a crowd, of course. At last it appears
      that I have to pay him what he asks and go down to the City Hall and make
      my complaint&mdash;hadn't told him how many steps there were, etc. So
      finally I agree to carry it up the steps myself, if he'll only leave it
      for a quarter!
    </p>
    <p>
      Next you must picture me breaking my back and tearing my fingers and the
      damned wall paper&mdash;while the damned frowsy-headed landlady yells and
      the damned frowsy-headed boarders stick out their heads! And so in the end
      I get into my steaming hot room and shut the door and fall down on the bed
      and burst into tears.

      O God, the stings of this bitter, haunting, horrible poverty! The ghastly
      weight that has hung about my neck since ever I can remember! Oh, shall I
      ever be free from it? Shall I ever know what it is to have what I ought to
      have, to think of my work without the intrusion of these degrading
      pettinesses?
    </p>
    <p>
      They are so infinite, so endless, so hideous! The thing gets to be a habit
      of my thoughts; my whole nature is steeped and soaked in it&mdash;in
      filthy sordidness! I plot and I plan all the day&mdash;I can not buy a
      newspaper without hesitating and debating&mdash;I am like a ragpicker
      going about the streets!
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes the thing goads me so that I think I must go mad&mdash;when I
      think of the time that I lose, of the power, of the courage! I walk miles
      when I am exhausted, to save a car-fare! I wear ragged collars and chafe
      my neck! I stand waiting in foul-smelling grocery shops with crowds of
      nasty people! I cook what I eat in a half-dirty frying-pan because I can
      not afford to pay the servant to wash it! So it is that I drag myself
      about&mdash;chafing and goaded&mdash;crouching and cringing like a whipped
      cur!

    <p>
      Six times in the course of my life, when I have been starved sick on my
      own feeding, I have become a &ldquo;table-boarder&rdquo;; and out of those six
      experiences I could make myself another Zola. The infinite variety of
      animality in those six vile stables&mdash;the champing jaws and the
      slobbering mouths and the rank odor of food! The men who shoveled with
      their knives or plastered things on their forks as hod-carriers do mortar!
      The women who sucked in their soup, and the children who smeared their
      faces and licked their lips and slopped upon the table-cloth! The fat
      Dutchman who grunted when he ate, and then leaned back and panted! The
      yellow woman with the false teeth who gathered everything about her on the
      table! The flashy gentleman with the diamond scarf-pin and the dirty
      cuffs, who made a tower out of his dirty dishes and then sucked his teeth!
      O God!

    <p>
      And the loathsome food!&mdash;For seven years I have had my nose stamped
      into this mud, and all in vain; I can still starve, but I can not eat what
      is not clean.

      &mdash;Some day I shall put into a book all the rage and all the hate and

      &mdash;When you think of my work you must think of these things! I do not
      mention them often, but they are never out of my mind. If you should read
      anything beautiful of mine, you must bear in mind that it is about half a
      chance that there was a dirty child screaming out in the hall while I
      wrote it.

      It took me a couple of days to realize that I have still not to go
      down-town. But I have a fine facility in making myself new habits! Just
      now I am on a four months' studying campaign. It is monotonous&mdash;to
      read about. I get up at six, and when I have had my breakfast and fixed a
      lunch, I go over into the Park. There are only birds and squirrels and a
      few tramps about then, and it is glorious. Sometimes I am so happy that I
      do not want to read; later come the squalling children and the hot sun;
      but I flit about from place to place. I wonder what they think of me!&mdash;

      I read all day, right straight along, and all night, now that it is not
      too hot. I have always done my reading by periods&mdash;I read our
      nineteenth-century poets that way, sixteen hours a day; I read Shakespeare
      in three weeks that way, and finished the month with Milton. So when I got
      German, I read Goethe and Schiller, and Molière and Hugo again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now I am reading history; it gives me the nightmare, but one has to read
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every night when I put down my book, I flee in thought to my own land as
      to a city of refuge. A history where everything counts! A history that is
      not a mad, blind chaos of blood and horror! A history that has other
      meaning than the drunken lust and the demon pride of a Napoleon or a Louis
      le Grand!
    </p>
    <p>
      &mdash;Some day the ages will discern two movements in history: the first,
      the Christian dispensation, and the second the American.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is a great deal in knowing how to read, especially with such books
      as history. I try to read as I write; to lash my author, to make him fill
      my mind. If he gets sluggish I am soon through with him&mdash;I read whole
      paragraphs in a sentence, and whole volumes in an hour.

      The third week of the publisher's month has gone by. God, how cruel is
      waiting! I wonder if their readers knew how hungry I am if they would not
      hurry a little!
    </p>
    <p>
      I say to myself&mdash;&ldquo;There has been enough of this nonsense! Oh, surely
      there will not be any more, surely these men must take it!&rdquo;

    <p>
      I still read the literary journals and tingle with excitement thinking of
      the time when The Captive is discussed in them. Can I believe that this
      book will not stir the world? If I did not believe it, I could not believe
      anything!
    </p>
    <p>
      I feel a new interest now in the authors that people talk about. I want to
      know who they are and what they do. And all the time I find myself
      thinking: &ldquo;Have I more than this man?&mdash;More than that man?&rdquo; That
      always throws me into despair, because I am a great admirer; and because I
      am always hypnotized by the last thing that I read.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I find very little that is great in modern books. Books are better
      made now than they ever were before&mdash;I mean in the way of literary
      craftsmanship. As far as form goes, there is no author living who would
      put together such a hodge-podge as Wilhelm Meister, or La Nouvelle
      Heloïse. But they all imitate each other; they are all mild and tame;
      there is no real power, no genius among them. They have even forgotten it
      exists.

      I came across this, for instance, the other day in a book of Mr.
      Howells's:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In fact, the whole belief in genius seems to me rather a mischievous
      superstition, and if not mischievous, always, still always, a
      superstition. From the account of those who talk about it, genius appears
      to be the attribute of a very potent and admirable prodigy which God has
      created out of the common for the astonishment and confusion of the rest
      of us poor human beings. Do they mean anything more or less than the
      mastery which comes to any man in accordance with his powers and diligence
      in any direction? If not, why not have an end to the superstition which
      has caused our race to go on for so long writing and reading of the
      difference between talent and genius?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Is not that simply blasphemous?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      &mdash;Have I genius? Ah, save the word!
    </p>
    <p>
      How can I know? It is none of my affair&mdash;I do my work.
    </p>
    <p>
      Genius is next to the last and most sacred word we know, next to God; and
      next to the most abused word. Every man will possess it, in degree
      proportionate to his vanity. I think if they knew the work and the terror
      that goes with even a grasp at it, they would not make so free with it.

      I wait&mdash;I wait for The Captive. I do all these other things&mdash;I
      read, I think, I study&mdash;but all the while I am merely passing the
      time. I am waiting for The Captive to win me the way. All my life hangs on
      that, I can do nothing else but pray for that&mdash;pray for it and yearn
      for it!
    </p>
    <p>
      &mdash;Yes&mdash;and do you know it?&mdash;I am sinking down every day!
      Down, down! The Captive is my high-water mark; where I was when I wrote
      that I shall never come again in my life&mdash;until I am given my freedom
      and new courage, and can set to work to toil as I did then!
    </p>
    <p>
      Tell me not about future books, foolish publishers! I have told you I put
      all that I had and all that I was into that book! And by that book I stand

      Their month is up. I walked down there to-day and saw them. &ldquo;The

     </p>
    <p>
      A second! That made my heart go like mad. &ldquo;Does that mean that the first
      is favorable?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It means that we are interested in it,&rdquo; the man answered; &ldquo;we will let

      Ah, God! I came home from the Park tonight, and I saw something that made
      my heart go down like lead. It hurt me so that I cried out!
    </p>
    <p>
      My manuscript! It was back again!
    </p>
    <p>
      O Christ! How the sight of it hurt me! There was a letter with it, and my
      hand shook as I opened it:
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />

    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Is not this awful? Oh, it is terrible! It is beyond belief! A whole month
      gone, and only a note like that to show for it! Four weeks of yearning and
      hoping&mdash;of watching the mail in agony&mdash;of struggling and toiling
      to forget! And then a note like this!
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, it drives me wild! I sat to-night in a chair motionless, forgetting
      that I was hungry, forgetting everything. I looked to the future; I had a
      feeling that I do not think I ever had in my life before&mdash;a horrible,
      black, yawning despair&mdash;a thing so fearful that it took my breath
      away. Suppose you were standing on a bridge over an abyss, and that
      suddenly it gave way, and in one dreadful instant you realized that you
      were going down&mdash;down like a flash&mdash;and that nothing could save
      you!

      &ldquo;Make one rule,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;expect nothing of the world. When you send out
      a manuscript, <i>know</i> that it is coming back!&mdash;Otherwise you go
      mad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But I should go mad <i>that</i> way. Why, what am I to do? How am I to
      work unless I can get free? I can not live a single day unless I have that
      hope. And if these blind creatures that make money out of books keep on
      sending my poem back&mdash;why, it will kill me&mdash;it will turn me into
      a fool!

      I did not go to bed last night until nearly daylight. I was desperate&mdash;I
      was crazy with perplexity. This thing had never occurred to me as the
      wildest possibility.
    </p>
    <p>
      I would pace the floor for hours; and then again sink into a stupor. &ldquo;They
      send it back! They don't want it!&rdquo;&mdash;I kept on muttering.&mdash;And,
      poor fool that I am, I had pictured to myself how they would read it. I
      saw the publisher himself glancing at a line of it by chance, and then
      rushing on. I saw him declaiming it with excited eyes&mdash;as I used to
      declaim it! Poor fool!

      &mdash;Well, I made another desperate attempt. I wrote last night to
      another poet that I respect&mdash;(the list is not very long). I wrote in
      the heat of my despair&mdash;I told him the whole story. I said that I was
      crying for the judgment of some one who had love and enthusiasm; some one
      who had another idea than making money out of it. I told him that I knew
      he had many such requests, but that he never had one from a man who had
      worked as I had. I pleaded that he need only read a few lines&mdash;I
      begged him to let me hear from him at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &mdash;And now I shall wait. I can't do anything else but wait!

      night&mdash;is it not with the hunger to go on that I am mad?&mdash;You

      me&mdash;because I had the need of praise and encouragement in my work?
      Give me a year's freedom&mdash;give me two hundred dollars&mdash;and I'll

      prate about, anyway? And what do you mean by &ldquo;getting my strength?&rdquo; Did I
      get my strength to write The Captive that day when those fishwives moved
      in next door to me? Did I get my strength to dream of my new work that day
      when I was chasing after an express-driver to save a quarter? Do I get it
      now when I am sitting here panting and ill with a headache, and with
      despair, and with lack of food? Damn such asininity, I say!
    </p>
    <p>
      What do you mean, I cry&mdash;what do you mean? Would it have helped Kant
      to solve the problems of the universe to have had a swarm of mosquitoes
      buzzing about his face? Would it have helped Beethoven to compose his
      symphonies to have had a dance hall over his head? What ghastly farce it
      is! That a poet is helped to realize his dreams and his joys in this
      hellish, reeking, market-place of a city! Why, I tell you, sir, that every
      hour that I have lived in it I have known that I have paid out unmeasured
      powers of my soul! And I know now, as every other poet knows, that when I
      am out of it I come with what pittance of strength I have been able to
      save from the horrible ordeal. Do you think that I am a fool that I do not
      know what inspires me and what degrades me? Why, sir, I sit here and watch
      my spirit wither like a frost-bitten plant!

      all things! I will wait and live and learn meanwhile, knowing with all my
      soul what this book is and what it must bring. So long as I can read it, I

      I saw a manuscript clerk this time. She was very airy. I fear I am a
      sad-looking poet&mdash;my buttonholes are beginning to wear out. &ldquo;We never

      &mdash;Yes, good poet, that is my answer to you. I can not take your
      advice&mdash;I will cling to my book&mdash;I will pin all my hopes to it!
      I will toil and strive for it, I will haunt men with it, I will shout it
      from the housetops. No other book&mdash;no future book&mdash;<i>this</i>

      our greatest, our noblest poet since Milton. He had his sacred
      inspiration, and the world laughed at it; and so, grimly, systematically,
      he set to work to teach them&mdash;to say to all men&mdash;to say to
      himself&mdash;to say day and night&mdash;&ldquo;It <i>is</i> poetry! It is <i>great</i>
      poetry! It is&mdash;<i>it is</i>!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And of course at last he made them believe him; and when they believed
      him, he&mdash;Wordsworth&mdash;was a matter-of-fact, self-centered, dull
      and poor old man.

      I am reading, reading&mdash;and trying to forget meanwhile! When I get
      through my long list of histories I shall go back to my Greek dramatists
      again. My Greek is getting better now&mdash;I expect to have a happy time
      with Aristophanes.&mdash;He is the funniest man that ever lived,
      Aristophanes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then I am coming back to read the French novelists. There are many of them
      I do not know. (I do not expect to like them&mdash;I do not like

      I was glancing to-day over a volume of Shelley's, and the memory of old
      glories thrilled in me. Ah, let me not forget what Shelley was to me in my
      young struggling days! Let me not forget while I am wrestling with a dull
      world&mdash;let me not forget what a poet is to young men hungering for
      beauty! Let me not forget!
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, it is to such that my appeal is, it is by such that I will be judged!
      It is for such that I toil! For hearts upon whom the cold world has not
      laid its hand! For the poets and the seekers of all ages! Oh come to me,
      poets and seekers of all ages&mdash;dwell in my memory and strengthen my
      soul! That I go not down altogether&mdash;that I be not overcome by the
      dull things about me!

    <p>
      These thoughts are not becoming to a reader of history. But I am not a
      good reader of history&mdash;the old beasts are still growling within me.
      Something starts a longing in me&mdash;I cry out that I am getting dull,
      that I am going down, that I am putting off&mdash;I, who never put off
      before! And so the old storms rise and the great waves come rolling again!

      I read that over just now. Yes, it is this that I dread. I dread the habit
      of not striving! When that becomes my habit it is my death! And here I
      sit, day by day&mdash;doing just the thing I dread! &ldquo;Let me go <i>now</i>!&rdquo;
       something shouts in me. &ldquo;<i>Now</i>&mdash;or I shall never go at all!&rdquo;

    <p>
      Oh, if I could find some word to tell men the terror of that thought!
    </p>
    <p>
      &mdash;It is my life&mdash;that is what it is! To obey this thing within

      a beast&mdash;that has beaten me like a storm of wind and struck me down
      upon the ground! It shakes me now&mdash;it shakes me all the time&mdash;it
      makes me scream with pain&mdash;incoherently, frantically. &ldquo;Oh save me!&mdash;Spare

      I have to go out in the streets and scream? Or what other desperate thing

      I sang a song to-day&mdash;a mad, mad song! I wish I could bring it back.
      It came to me unexpectedly, while I was kneeling by the bed, thinking.
    </p>

      I have forgotten it all now&mdash;one always forgets his best songs. I

    <p>
      I have a distant relative in this city, an old gentleman who belongs to
      clubs and is what is known as a &ldquo;man of the world.&rdquo; He has quite a sense
      of humor&mdash;is famous for good stories. He told me that he was
      interested in me&mdash;that he would be glad to find a place for me in
      life, if I would only get over my youthful follies. It has been years
      since I saw him, but I can still hear him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The last words he ever said to me were these&mdash;said with his quiet,
      amused smile: &ldquo;Never mind, my boy, leave it to time. You needn't argue
      with me&mdash;just leave it to time, and it'll come out all right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Never have I sunk into a fit of despair that I have not thought of that;
      and the quiet smile has become the sneer of an imp. It has become all the
      world watching me, and knowing full well the issue; wise world!
    </p>
    <p>
      That memory has never yet lost its power to make me grip my hands
      suddenly. &ldquo;So! And my life has no other purpose, then, than to point a
      moral for a rich clubman!&rdquo;

      never are less&mdash;never faster&mdash;never slower&mdash;that wear you
      out as water wears a stone! Leave it to time! Say nothing, fear nothing;
      leave it to time! Leave it to the hours of dulness, the hours of sickness,
      the hours of despair! Leave it to failure piled upon failure, to insult
      piled upon insult, to rebuff upon rebuff, to sneer upon sneer! Leave it to
      the endless, never-ceasing sight of ugliness; the endless, never-ceasing
      sight of selfishness; of pettiness, emptiness, heartlessness, hatefulness!
      Leave it to heat and to cold, to dust and to dirt, to hunger and penury,
      to headache and heartache, and bitter, bitter loneliness! Leave it to
      time! Leave it to time!&mdash;<i>Oh my Father in heaven!</i>

      It has been four weeks yesterday! I have been expecting to hear from the
      last publishers every day for a week. I have been trembling while I
      watched each mail. I have more than a hope that these publishers will take
      it&mdash;they publish a deal of poetry.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I have been practising my friend's plan, I have been saying to myself
      all day: &ldquo;You might as well know that it is coming back. What is the use
      of trying to deceive yourself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It has been four months since I finished The Captive! If I had known then

    <p>
      What do I know <i>now</i>?

      It is two months to-day since I gave up my last place. I have gotten along
      on just three dollars a week, including everything. I find it is not
      possible to do better than that, there are so many odds and ends one
      needs. I have spent twenty-seven dollars. I have twenty-nine dollars. That
      means I can try two, or possibly three, publishers&mdash;after this one.

      &ldquo;We have read with care the manuscript of The Captive which you have
      offered us. We are pleased to be able to tell you that we have found it a
      very fine piece of work, but we are sorry to say that our previous
      experience with publications of this character does not lead us to believe
      that we could make a success of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are holding MS. subject to your order.&rdquo;

    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      I did a desperate thing to-day&mdash;two of them. First I had to go and
      get the manuscript, so I asked to see the publisher. I sat down and looked
      straight into his face and said: &ldquo;How is a man who is trying to write what
      is fine to keep alive if the publishers won't publish what he writes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was very kind&mdash;he seemed to be interested. He explained that a
      publisher who published books that the public did not want would be driven
      out of business in a year. Then he said he knew many who were facing the
      same problem as I; that there was nothing to do but write for the
      magazines and the papers, and that it was a bitter shame that society made
      no provision for such men. &ldquo;Your work is as noble and sincere as work can
      be,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but I do not believe that you will find a publisher in this
      country to undertake it, unless there be one who feels wealthy enough to
      do it as a service to literature and a labor of love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      That made me turn white. I got my manuscript and I went out on the street,
      and the houses reeled about me. &ldquo;So,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;and that settles it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As I walked along I stared into the future. It seemed very clear all of a
      sudden.
    </p>
    <p>
      I thought it all out. &ldquo;No one will publish The Captive,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;and no
      one would heed it if it were published. Therefore I have but one question
      to face, Have I the strength to go on, living as I have lived, distracted
      and tormented as I have been&mdash;and still piling up new emotions in my
      soul, daring new efforts, reaching new heights, producing new books? I can
      have no idea that my second work will be any more available than my first;
      on the contrary, I know that it would be just what The Captive is, only
      more so. Therefore, perhaps it will be ten years&mdash;perhaps it will be
      twenty years&mdash;before men begin to pay any heed to what I have
      written! And so there is the question, Have I the strength to go on in
      that way&mdash;have I the strength to face that future?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then I grew faint and had to lean against a railing. <i>I knew that I
      could not do that!</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      It is no question of what I will do! It is a question of what I <i>can</i>
      do! I am weakened and sick with the yearning that I have in me already. My
      last &ldquo;business&rdquo; experience drove me mad. And I am to go on, I am to rouse
      new hunger, new passion, new agony in my soul! Why, the work that I have
      dreamed of next is so hard and so far-away that I hardly dared even
      whisper it! It would take years and years of toiling! And I am to do it
      here in this seething city&mdash;to do it while I sell wholesale-paper&mdash;to
      do it while I am sick for lack of food! I can not do it! I <i>can</i> not!
    </p>
    <p>
      I went home, and I was crazy; so it was that I did my second desperate
      thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      I sat down and wrote a letter to Mr. &mdash;&mdash;. I wrote a letter&mdash;I
      can not see how it could fail to stir the soul of any man. I told him how
      I had toiled&mdash;I told him how for four long months I had waited in
      agony&mdash;I told him what the publishers had said to me. I begged him&mdash;I
      implored him&mdash;for the sake of the unuttered message that cried out
      day and night in my soul&mdash;not to throw the letter aside&mdash;to read
      it&mdash;to give me a chance to talk to him. I said: &ldquo;I will live in a
      hut, I will cook my own food, I will wear the clothes of a day laborer! If
      I can only be free&mdash;if I can only be free to be an artist! I could do
      it, all of it, for two hundred dollars a year; and I could win the battle,
      I know, if I had but three years. I am desperate as I write to you&mdash;I
      look ahead and I can see only ruin; and not ruin for myself&mdash;I do not
      mind that&mdash;but ruin for my art! I can tell you what that means to me
      in but one way&mdash;I ask you to read my book. I have put all my soul
      into that book&mdash;I will stake my all upon it. If you will only read
      it, you will see what I mean&mdash;you will see why I have written you
      this letter. You will see that it is not a beggar's letter, but a high
      challenge from an artist's soul.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      So there is one chance more. I do not see how he can refuse, and if he
      will only read the manuscript, I will be safe, I think.

    <p>
      November 20th.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have done nothing but wait for four days, but I have not heard from him
      yet. To-day I made up my mind that I would take the manuscript to another
      publisher's meanwhile. He is probably busy, and may not answer for a long
      while; and I can get the manuscript from a publisher at any time.

    </p>
    <p>
      Still I have not heard anything from Mr. &mdash;&mdash;. My soul was full
      of hope again, but it is sinking down as before. Is he not going to answer
      me at all?&mdash;Can it be that he has not even read my letter?

    <p>
      I wrote to him again to-day, inquiring. If he does not answer that, I
      shall suppose his secretary threw it away.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is nothing weakens my soul like this endless waiting. I wander
      around desolate, helpless, I can not fix my mind on anything. Oh, the
      shame of it!

      I could not give up that hope yet. It seemed to me so terrible that of all
      the men of wealth in this city there should not be one willing to help me
      save my message.&mdash;I wrote to-day the same letter to a clergyman who I
      know is wealthy, and who I believe would be interested in my work.

      all of us have to share; and I assure you that you are entirely mistaken
      if you think that an artist has nothing to expect but ruin from contact
      with the world, and with suffering and toiling humanity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Isn't that a slap in the face for you?
    </p>
    <p>
      Great God, I think that is the most insulting thing that has ever happened
      to me in all my days. &ldquo;Set free from the labor which all of us have to
      share!&rdquo;&mdash;What do you think I am&mdash;a tramp, or a loafer, you
      hound!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A high challenge from an artist's soul!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I think I never had so much hatred in my heart in all my life as I have
      to-day. Oh, my God, what a thing this world is! What stupid, blind
      brutality, what hideous vulgarity! This man a <i>clergyman</i>! And this
      is his faith, his nobility, his understanding!
    </p>
    <p>
      Why, I came out of the forest with my naked heart in my hands! I came out
      quivering with emotion, melting with love and with trust for all men! I
      came all sensitive and raw&mdash;hungering for sympathy and kindness! And
      oh, my soul!&mdash;my God!&mdash;you have beaten me and kicked me as if I
      were a filthy cur!
    </p>
    <p>
      Had I not offered up my heart for a sacrifice? Had I not burned it with
      fire? Had I not made all my being one consecration? And all for men, for
      men! For men I had torn myself&mdash;lashed myself&mdash;killed myself&mdash;for
      men I had forgotten what self was&mdash;yes, literally that&mdash;forgotten
      what self was! So little self had I left that I was willing to ask favors!
      So much consecration had I, so much trust, that I would beg! I had wept&mdash;I
      had suffered&mdash;I had starved! I had dreamed and sung, toiled until I
      set fire to my very brain! And you have beaten me and kicked me as if I
      were a filthy cur!
    </p>
    <p>
      Those thoughts turn my whole soul into one wild curse! Have done with
      laying bare your heart to men, have done with telling your life to men!
      Why should you go on trying to be a poet, go on putting your secret soul
      into books, to be spurned at by the rabble? Your soul is your own&mdash;it
      is your God's&mdash;and what have the rabble to do with it! And all its
      tenderness! all its shrinking ecstasy! all its holiest consecration!&mdash;You
      will take them out to sell them to the rabble!
    </p>
    <p>
      When will you get back into yourself, you fool? When will you have learned
      your lesson, and let this hellish world boot you out of its way no more?
      Let ever any man know a gleam of your heart again!&mdash;see one trace of
      your joy!

      I was reading an essay on Balzac to-day. I read about Balzac's fondness
      for <i>things</i>; and I put the book down and spent an hour of
      perplexity. I fear I am a very narrow person in my sympathies and
      understandings. Why should a man care about <i>things</i>! About all sorts
      of houses and furniture, and pictures, and clothes, and jewels!
    </p>
    <p>
      I can understand a man's caring about love and joy and aspiration. But <i>things</i>!
      I can understand a child's caring about things, or a fool's caring; I see
      millions of such; but an artist? A thinker? A <i>man</i>?

    <p>
      I am reading novels nowadays&mdash;reading all sorts of things that <i>entertain</i>.
      I have not read a poem for a long time, I have no interest in reading
      unless I can <i>go</i> with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have been studying some of the French novelists&mdash;some of Maupassant
      yesterday. What a strange creature is a Frenchman! A nervous, hysterical,
      vain, diseased creature!

      &ldquo;The Gallic disease!&rdquo; Let that be a phrase.
    </p>

      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The Gallic disease is this: to see only one thing in life, to know only
      one purpose, to understand only one pleasure; to have every road lead to
      that, every thought, every phrase. To know that every character in a book
      is thinking it; to know that every man who is introduced is looking for a
      woman! And that as soon as he finds her, they must forthwith&mdash;whatever
      be their age, rank, character, and position at the moment&mdash;begin to
      burn with unclean desires!
    </p>
    <p>
      That is what one might call the <i>convention</i> of French fiction. It
      gets very monotonous when you are used to it; it takes all of the interest
      out of the story. For there is but one ending to such a story.
    </p>
    <p>
      One's whole being is lowered by contact with that incessant animal appeal.

      I have discovered another trouble&mdash;as if I did not have enough! I am

      anything for an hour after a meal, no matter what simplest thing I have
      eaten.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so all through my life I am to be hindered in my work by having to

      In two days more it will be three months since I gave up my situation. I
      count my little hoard day by day, as a castaway might, or a besieged
      garrison. I have begun to try to get along on cheap foods again&mdash;(that
      is the reason of my indigestion). Yesterday I burned a mess of oatmeal,
      and now I shall live on burned oatmeal for I know not how long. I was
      cooking a large quantity to save time.

      everything that is cheap has no taste?

      hope, and I can not fight as I did before.

      To-day I happened to read in one of the magazines an article on a literary
      subject by a college professor of some reputation. It was a fine piece of
      work, I thought, very true; and I got to thinking of him, wondering if <i>he</i>
      might not be the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have no hope that these last publishers will take the book, and so I
      made up my mind to write to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      I wrote what I had written to all the others; I told him how I had
      struggled, and how I was living. Perhaps he is less busy than the rest.

    <p>
      &ldquo;I reply to your letter somewhat against my rule&mdash;chiefly because of
      what you tell me about your circumstances. I will read your manuscript if
      you still think it worth while to send it to me; but I must tell you at
      the outset that I consider the chances very unfavorable, as regards my
      finding the work what you believe it. I assure you that the literary
      situation is not in the least what you picture it; the book-market was
      never more wide-awake than it is now, the publishers are all as eager as
      possible for the least sign of new power; and besides that, the magazines
      afford outlet&mdash;not only for talent, but for mediocrity as well. You
      are entirely mistaken in your idea that literary excellence is not
      equivalent to commercial availability. If you could write one paragraph as
      noble as the average of Dr. &mdash;&mdash;, or one stanza as excellent as
      the average of Professor &mdash;&mdash;, you would find an instant and
      hearty welcome.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Moreover, I believe that you are entirely wrong in your ideas of what you
      need. You will not make yourself a great artist by secluding yourself from
      men&mdash;go out into the world, young man, go out into the world and see
      what men are!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As I say, it is not my rule to answer letters such as yours. The cry of
      the suffering is in the air every instant, if we heeded it we should never
      get our work done. But I am willing to read your poem, if this letter has
      not chilled your ardor.&rdquo;

      forgotten something, and as if half my mind were on that. I have lost all

      I had been walking down the street during the day and had seen a flower in
      a window, and had been made happy for a minute, thinking of last spring.
      My step had grown light, and I had forgotten the street around me. But
      then I had heard two little girls, sitting in a doorway, whisper
      excitedly: &ldquo;Oh, look&mdash;he's laughing!&rdquo; And instantly all my soul had
      shrunk up, and my dream had fled, and I had hurried past and turned the
      corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Is it not a strange thing? I mused&mdash;this as I sat by the window&mdash;that
      deep instinct of secrecy&mdash;that cowardice! Why is it that I would die
      before I would let any man see the life of my soul? What are these people
      to me? I know them not at all, and never shall. But I crouch back&mdash;I
      put on a mask&mdash;yes, think of it, I even <i>give</i> up the life of my
      soul, rather than that any man should see me acting differently than
      himself!
    </p>
    <p>
      Somehow all at once that thought took hold of me with an overwhelming
      power&mdash;I saw the truth as I had never seen it before in my life. I
      saw how we live in society; and how social convention and triviality have
      us in such a grasp that it never even dawns upon us that the laws it
      dictates are not eternal and necessary! &ldquo;You must be dignified, and calm,
      and commonplace,&rdquo; say social convention and triviality.
    </p>
    <p>
      &mdash;But I am <i>not</i> dignified&mdash;I am <i>not</i> calm!&mdash;I
      am <i>not</i> commonplace!
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, then, you must <i>seem</i> so. You must walk quietly; you must gaze
      around indifferently; you must keep a vacant face; you must try to look
      innocent of a thought. If you can't manage that&mdash;if you really want
      to think&mdash;why then you must flee away to the woods, where you are
      sure no one will come upon you and find you out. And if you can't do that&mdash;why
      then there's nothing for you to do but give up thinking, give up living,
      become like everybody else!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      That idea shook me all of a sudden, it made me quite wild&mdash;it made me
      dig my nails into my hands. It was the truth&mdash;I saw that&mdash;it was
      the truth! Here I was, a miserable, pining, starving wretch&mdash;and for
      no reason in the world but that I was a coward, but that I was a coward&mdash;a
      blind fool! Because I had not let the empty-headed and sodden, the placid
      and smug, the fat and greasy citizens of our great metropolis, tell <i>me</i>&mdash;the
      servant of the muses&mdash;how I ought to look, how I ought to act, what I
      ought to be! The very breath of my body is prayer&mdash;is effort&mdash;is
      vision; to dwell in my own light, to behold my own soul, to know my own
      truth&mdash;that is my one business in this world! To assert my own force&mdash;to
      be what I like&mdash;that is my duty, that is my hope, my one hope in all
      the world! And I do not, I can not, I dare not do it! I am sick and
      starved and dying, and I crouch in corners while I pray for help, and if a
      gleam of sunshine comes from a flower to me, it goes because a child sees
      me laughing!
    </p>
    <p>
      I sat burning with the rage of that. What am I to do? I cried. How is it
      to be changed? Shall I live my life in spite of all men?
    </p>
    <p>
      And then I heard one of my devils&mdash;my commonplace devil&mdash;say,
      &ldquo;But people would think you were crazy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do I care what people think?&rdquo; I burst out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then came another of my devils&mdash;my facetious devil&mdash;and he made
      me laugh. &ldquo;By all means,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;let us get together a few eager poets,
      and establish a Society for the Propagation of Lunacy. Let us break down
      these conventions and confound the eyes of the fat and greasy citizens,
      and win freedom for our souls at any price. Let us wear strange clothes,
      and recite our poetry upon the streets. Let us&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But I was not in a mood for my facetious devil&mdash;I flung him aside and
      sprang up and fled out to the street (this in thought, of course). What do
      I need with others? I exclaimed&mdash;with others to help me dare? This
      has to do with <i>me</i>! And it has to do with me <i>now</i>&mdash;with
      this moment! Am I to give up and let myself go down for such a phantom as
      this! For such a dread as that wooden-headed men and women will think me
      &ldquo;queer&rdquo;! Am I to stay in a prison such as that&mdash;to be bound by a
      chain such as <i>that</i>? I&mdash;I, who go about trying to persuade
      myself that this world is nothing to me&mdash;that this world is nothing
      to any one&mdash;that it is a phantom&mdash;that the soul is truth! When I
      say that the soul is truth, do I mean it? Do I <i>mean</i> it? And if I do
      mean it, will I act by it&mdash;will I act by it now&mdash;<i>now</i>,
      while I see it? Will I fling off this nightmare, will I tear my way
      through these wrappings that have choked me? Will I say, once and for all
      time, that I will be myself&mdash;that I will live my life&mdash;and that
      no man shall stop me&mdash;that no man shall make me afraid? Will I take
      the battle upon me and win it&mdash;win it <i>now</i>&mdash;fling off the
      last rag of it&mdash;put the world straight behind me&mdash;<i>now</i>&mdash;<i>here</i>?
      Spread the wings of my soul and take my flight into the far spaces of
      myself! And dwell there&mdash;stay there&mdash;hold to the task and give
      it not up though it kill me&mdash;now&mdash;<i>now</i>!
    </p>
    <p>
      These thoughts took hold of me&mdash;they made my brain reel&mdash;and I
      cried aloud in excitement. I had not been so much awake since the day I
      came out of the woods! I said the word&mdash;I said it&mdash;the mad word
      that I had not heard for six long months&mdash;that I had not heard since
      I wrote the last lines of my poem and came back to the haunts of men. And
      I clinched my hands, and stamped upon the ground, and shouted: &ldquo;Come on!
      Come on!&rdquo;&mdash;to the legions of my spirit. And it was like the taking
      flight of a great swarm of birds within me&mdash;a rushing of wings and a
      surging upward, a singing for joy as of a symphony. And there was singing
      in my soul, the surge of it caught me&mdash;and I waved my arms and went
      striding on, shouting still, &ldquo;Come on! Come on!&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now! <i>now</i>! We will have it out with them&mdash;here&mdash;<i>here</i>!
      We will fight our fight and win it, and they shall not turn us back&mdash;no,
      by God, they shall not! And they may take it as they please&mdash;my soul
      is free&mdash;<i>free</i> once again! Away! <i>Away!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And I felt the breeze of the mountains about me, and heard the rushing of
      the storm-wind and the trampling of the thunder. There awoke the old rush
      in my heart, the old Valkyrie music that flies over the forests and
      mountains. And I laughed as I sang it; I heard the war-horses neighing,
      and yelled to them&mdash;faster and faster&mdash;higher and higher&mdash;away
      from earth and all men!&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      And then suddenly I felt some one seize me by the shoulder and shake me,
      and heard a gruff voice say: &ldquo;Here! Here! What's the matter with you?&rdquo; And
      I stared, half-dazed. It was a big policeman, and around me I saw a sea of
      staring faces, wild-eyed children, women gazing in fright, boys jeering;
      and the windows were filled with yet another crowd!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the matter with you?&rdquo; demanded the policeman again. &ldquo;Are you
      drunk, or crazy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And then I realized. But the fire was still blazing in me, and a wild rage
      whirled over me. &ldquo;Then it is by this that I am to be stopped!&rdquo; I gasped.
      &ldquo;By <i>this</i>! It is not possible after all, it seems; and I'm to be
      dragged back after all!&mdash;By Heaven, we'll see!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And so I gave the cry again&mdash;the cry of the Valkyrs that is madness
      to me! Do you not hear it?&mdash;and I was away again and free!
    </p>
    <p>
      What does a man want for his soul, if it be not just to strive, and to be
      resisted, and still to strive? What difference makes anything else&mdash;time,
      place or conditions? I was myself again&mdash;and what else did I care
      about? I felt the policeman take me by the collar and march me down the
      street; but I hardly knew that&mdash;I was on the mountains, and I laughed
      and sang. The very hatefulness of what was about me was my desperation&mdash;I
      would make head against such things or I would die in the attempt! I would
      be free!&mdash;I would live! I would live my life; and not the life of
      these people about me! I would fight and win, I would hold fast my heart,
      I would be true though the heavens fell! I would have it out, then and
      there, as I said&mdash;I would not come back to earth until I was master
      of myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so when I stood in the station-house and the sergeant asked me my
      name, I said: &ldquo;Desire is my name, and the soul is my home!&rdquo; And then
      because they shook me and worried me, I stretched forth my arms and cried
      out: &ldquo;O God, my Father&mdash;thou who art my help and my life&mdash;thou
      soul of my soul&mdash;shall I go back for these things?&mdash;Shall I fear
      for these things? No, no&mdash;while I have life I will not! I will live
      for the truth, I will be crushed no longer!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They led me to a cell, and when I heard the door shut I laughed like a
      madman for joy. And then&mdash;ah, then&mdash;who can tell it? They came&mdash;all
      my angels and all my demons! All my muses and all my nymphs! And the bases
      of the earth rocked and the heavens danced and sang; and I mounted on the
      wings of the ages, and saw the joys of the systems and the dancing of the
      young suns. Until I could bear it no more, and fell down and sobbed, and
      cried out to my soul that it was enough, enough!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      And afterward I sat there on the stone floor, and ate bread and water and
      ambrosial peace; and a doctor came in to see me, and asked me who I was.
      And I laughed&mdash;oh, who ever laughed like that? And I said, <i>&ldquo;I am
      the author of The Captive!&rdquo;</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      He left me and I sat there, shaking my head and pounding the stone floor
      for joy. And I sang again, and sang again. Yes, the author of The Captive!
      And captive myself, and free at last!
    </p>
    <p>
      It was far into the night when I stopped singing; and then I lay down and
      never before had I known such peace; for I had found the way&mdash;I had
      seen the light&mdash;I was delivered from all fear and dulness for the
      rest of my days! I was so excited I could not sleep&mdash;when I fell
      asleep at last it was from sheer exhaustion.
    </p>
    <p>
      And when they roused me the next morning I bounded to my feet like a shot,
      and shouted to my soul, and was up and away through the forest like a
      startled deer again! They tried their very best to catch me, but they
      could not. I had not lived in the woods for nothing, I knew the paths, I
      knew where the mountains were. And when they thought they had me in court,
      I was on the very summits&mdash;and laughing and drunk with the mountain
      air!
    </p>
    <p>
      I have a keen sense of humor,&mdash;and of course I am never so drunk that
      I do not know I'm drunk, and know just what I'm drunk about&mdash;else how
      could I write poems about it? Do you think that when Shakespeare cried out
      his &ldquo;Blow ye winds and crack your cheeks!&rdquo; he did not know just what he
      was saying? Ah!&mdash;And when I saw all these queer little men about me,
      staring and wondering&mdash;and so solemn!&mdash;I laughed the
      inextinguishable laughter of Olympus, and shouted so that they dragged me
      out of court in a hurry.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      And then there came the end! They took me to the insane asylum, and I sat
      down on the floor of a cell and gazed at myself in amazement and panted:
      So there <i>is</i> a way you can live, after all! There <i>is</i> a way
      you can make them support you! There <i>is</i> a way you can do all your
      work in peace, and worship the Lord in the beauty of holiness! I could
      scarcely believe it all&mdash;it took half an hour for me to realize it.
      And then I shouted that I was saved!&mdash;and fell to work at shaping
      that mad Song of the West Wind I had been so full of.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      And then suddenly I heard a muffled voice say: &ldquo;What in the dickens are
      you making all that rumpus for?&rdquo; And I stared about me and saw that I was
      still crouching by the window in my room! And I shrank back and quivered
      with rage, because I knew that I had been making a noise and that some one
      out in the hall had been listening to me!
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />

    <p>
      And that was the end of my long adventure.

    <p>
      &ldquo;I am pleased to be able to tell you that your poem is a great deal better
      than I expected to find it. I am forced to write briefly by reason of
      pressure of business; but you have very considerable literary gifts. The
      work is clearly made whole of sincerity; it shows a considerable command
      of expression, and a considerable understanding of style. It has qualities
      of imagination and of emotional insight, and is obviously the fruit of a
      wide reading. But besides these things, it is exactly as I expected, and
      as I told you&mdash;the work is very narrow in the range of its appeal;
      you can not in the least blame the publishers for declining it, because it
      is true that very few people would care for it. My own judgment is hardly
      capable in the matter, because I myself am not an idealist. Recording my
      own opinion, I found the poem monotonous, and not especially interesting;
      but then, I say that of much that some other people consider great poetry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My advice to you is just what it was before&mdash;that you go out into
      the world and become acquainted with life. Not knowing you personally, I
      could not counsel you definitely, but I should think that what would
      benefit you most would be a good stiff course in plain, every-day
      newspaper reporting. Newspaper reporters have many deficiencies, but at
      least they learn to keep in touch with their audiences, and to write in a
      way that takes hold of the people. You may not welcome this advice&mdash;but
      we seldom welcome what is good for us.&rdquo;

      I am not dead yet, and I have not lost the power of getting angry. Such
      things as that do me good, they make me fight, they get all my soul in
      arms. Great God, the blindness, the asininity of it!
    </p>
    <p>
      It is enough if you can classify a man; give him a name&mdash;and then
      it's all out of the way. If he have faith and fire and aspiration and
      worship&mdash;and you have not&mdash;why, say that he is an idealist, and
      that you are something else, and let it go at that.

      The poem came back to-day, and I trudged off to another publisher's&mdash;the
      sixth. I have no hope now, however; I send it as a matter of form.
    </p>
    <p>
      I shudder at the prospect of to-morrow's coming; for it will be just a
      month more to the time I said I should have to go to work!
    </p>
    <p>
      And New Year's day&mdash;my soul, if I had foreseen this last New Year's!
      I thank Heaven for that blessing, at least.
    </p>
    <p>
      Who are these men that I should submit to their judgments? These men and
      their commonplace lives&mdash;are they not that very world out of which I
      have fought my way, by the toil of nights and days?&mdash;And now I must
      come back and listen to their foolish judgments about my song!
    </p>
    <p>
      &mdash;You felt what was in it, you poor, stupid man! But it did not take
      you with it, for you are not a poet; you have not kept the holy fire
      burning, you are not still &ldquo;strenuous for the bright reward.&rdquo; And so you
      found it monotonous! Some men find nature monotonous. And some men find
      music monotonous.

      January 5th.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two days ago I was reading Menschen und Werke, by Georg Brandes. I was
      glancing over an essay on Friedrich Nietzsche, and I came upon some things
      that made my heart throb:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This man [Nietzsche's ideal] takes willingly upon himself the sorrow of
      speaking the truth. His chief thought is this: A happy life is an
      impossibility; the highest that man can attain is a heroic life, a life in
      which, amid the greatest difficulties, something is striven for which, in
      one way or other, proves for the good of all. To what is truly human only
      the true men can lift us, those who seem to have come into being through a
      leap of nature, the thinkers and discoverers, the artists and producers,
      and those who achieve more through their being than their doing; the
      noble, the good in a great sense, those in whom the genius of the good
      works. These men are the goal of history. Nietzsche formulates the
      sentence 'Humanity shall labor continually at this, to beget solitary
      great men&mdash;and this and nothing else is its task.'&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here Nietzsche has reached the final answer to his question 'What is
      Culture?' For upon this rest the fundamental principles of Culture, and
      the duties which it imposes. It lays upon me the duty to place myself
      actively in relation to the great human ideals. Its chief thought is this:
      To every one who will look for it and partake of it, it sets the task; to
      labor in himself and outside of himself at the begetting of the thinker
      and the artist, the truth-loving and the beauty-loving man, the pure and
      good personality&mdash;and therewith at the fulfilment of nature....
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In our day a so-called Culture institution signifies only too often an
      arrangement by which the cultured, moving in closed ranks, force to one
      side all those solitary and contrary ones whose striving is directed to
      higher things. Also among the learned there is so far lacking, as a rule,
      all sense for the genius that is coming into being, and every feeling for
      the work of the contemporary and struggling soul. Therefore, in spite of
      the irresistible and restless advance in all technical and specialized
      fields, the conditions for the originating of the great are so little
      improved that the opposition to the highly gifted has rather increased
      than diminished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From the government the superior individuals can not expect much. It
      helps them rarely when it takes them into its service, very certainly it
      will help them only when it gives them full independence. Only true
      Culture can prevent their early becoming weary or exhausted, and protect
      them from the exasperating battle with Culture-philistinism.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Those words made my blood tingle, they made me tremble. Alone, miserable,
      helpless&mdash;here was a voice at last, a friend! I dropped the book and
      I went to the library, and I was back with &ldquo;Also sprach Zarathustra&rdquo; in an
      hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      I have been reading it for two days&mdash;reading it in a state of
      excitement, forgetting everything. Here is a man!&mdash;Here is a man! The
      first night that I read it I kicked my heels together and laughed aloud in
      glee, like a child. <i>Oh</i>, it was so fine! And to find things like
      this already written, and in the world! Great heavens, it was like finding
      a gold mine underneath my feet; and I have forgotten all my troubles
      again, forgotten everything! I have found a man who understands me, a man
      to be my friend!

      I do not know what the name Friedrich Nietzsche conveys to the average
      cultured American. I can only judge by my own case&mdash;I have kept pace
      with our literary movements and I have read the standard journals and
      reviews; but I have never come upon even a reference to Friedrich
      Nietzsche, except as a byword and a jest.

      I had rather live my own life than any other man's life. My own vision is

      I speak not of poets, nor of philosophers, but of religious teachers, of
      prophets; and I speak but my opinion&mdash;let every man form his own. I
      say that I have read all those that men honor, and that a greater prophet
      than this man has not come upon the earth in centuries. I think of Emerson
      and Carlyle as the religious teachers, the prophets, of this time; and
      beside this mighty spirit Emerson is a child and Carlyle a man without a
      faith or an idea. I call him the John Baptist of the new Dispensation, the
      first high priest of the Religion of Evolution; and I bid the truth-seeker
      read well his Bible, for in it lies the future of mankind for ages upon
      ages to come.

      Half that I love in my soul's life I owe to the prophet of Nazareth. The

      which he is a priest. Nietzsche will stand alone; but he is nevertheless
      the child of his age&mdash;he sings what thousands feel.

      It is a disadvantage to be the first man. If you are the first man you see
      but half-truths and you hate your enemies. When you seek truth, truly, all
      systems and all faiths of men&mdash;they are beautiful to you&mdash;born
      of sorrow, and hallowed with love; but they will not satisfy you, and you
      put them by. You do not let them influence you one way or the other; you
      can no more find truth while you are bound to them by hatred than while
      you are bound to them by love. There are dreary places in &ldquo;Also sprach
      Zarathustra,&rdquo; narrownesses and weaknesses too; they come whenever the
      writer is thinking of the evils of the hour, whenever he is gazing, not on
      the vision of his soul, but on the half-truths of the men about him.

      When I speak of Christ let no man think of Christianity. I speak of a
      prince of the soul, the boldest, the freest, the noblest of men that I
      know. With the thousand systems that mankind has made in his memory, I
      have simply nothing in any way to do.

      To me all morality is one. Morality is hunger and thirst after
      righteousness. Morality is a quality of will. The differences that there
      are between Christ and Nietzsche are differences of the intellect&mdash;where
      no man is final.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctrine of each is a doctrine of sacrifice; with one it is a
      sacrifice of love, with the other it is a sacrifice of labor. For myself,
      I care not for the half-truths of any man. I said to my soul, &ldquo;Shall I
      cast out love for labor?&rdquo; And my soul replied, &ldquo;For what wilt thou labor
      but love?&rdquo;

    <p>
      Moral sublimity lies in the escape from self. The doctrine of Christ is a
      negation of life, that of Nietzsche an affirmation; it seems to me much
      easier to attain to sublimity with the former.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is easier to die for righteousness than to live for it. If you are to
      die, you have but to fix your eyes upon your vision, and see that you do
      not take them away. But the man who will <i>live</i> for righteousness&mdash;he
      must plant and reap, must gather fire-wood and establish a police-force;
      and to do these things nobly is not easy; to do them sublimely seems
      hardly possible at all.

      Twenty centuries ago the Jewish world was a little plain, and God a loving
      Father. He held you in his arms, he spoke to you in every dream, in every
      fantasy, in every accident. Life was very short&mdash;but a little trial&mdash;you
      had only to be patient, and nothing mattered. Society did not exist&mdash;only
      your neighbor existed. Knowledge did not exist, nor was it needed&mdash;the
      world was to end&mdash;perhaps to-night&mdash;and what difference made all
      the rest? You took no heed for the morrow&mdash;for would not your Father
      send you bread? You resisted not evil&mdash;for if you died, was not that
      all that you could ask?
    </p>
    <p>
      It was with such a sweet and simple faith as this that the victory of
      Jesus Christ was won. These were his ideas, and as the soul was
      all-consuming with him, he lived by them and died by them, and stands as
      the symbol of faith.

    <p>
      And now twenty centuries have gone by. And a new teacher has come to whom
      also the soul is all-consuming. What ideas has <i>he</i>? And what task
      does he face?

      I speak not to children. I speak to men seeking truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      In twenty centuries we have learned that God is not a Father who answers
      prayers and works miracles and holds out his arms at the goal. We have
      come shuddering to the awful mystery of being; strange and terrible words
      have been spoken&mdash;words never to be forgotten&mdash;&ldquo;phenomenon,&rdquo; and
      &ldquo;thing-in-itself&rdquo;; not knowing what these words mean, you are ignorant and
      recreant to the truth; <i>knowing</i> what they mean, you tug no more at
      the veil. Also we have learned that time and change are our portion, &ldquo;the
      plastic dance of circumstance&rdquo;; we talk no more of immortality. We have
      turned our hopes to the new birth of time, to the new goal of our labor,
      the new parent of our love, that we name Society.
    </p>
    <p>
      And likewise Evolution has come, which is the whole of knowledge. And we
      have learned of starry systems, of the building of worlds, of the pageant
      of history and the march of mind. Out of all these things has come a new
      duty, which is not peace, but battle&mdash;which is not patience, but will&mdash;which
      is not death, but life.

    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      There is no room in the world of Evolution for the doctrine of
      non-resistance to evil. Non-resistance to evil is the negation of life,
      and the negation of life is the negation of faith. How shall you resist
      not evil when life is action and not passion? When not a morsel of food
      can you touch except by the right that you are more fitted to survive than
      that morsel? How when you know that you rose from the beast by resistance?
      And that you stay above the beast by resistance? Will you give up the farm
      land to be jungle again? Or will you teach the beasts your non-resistance?
      And the trees of the forest to crowd no more your land!
    </p>
    <p>
      It is no longer possible to build a heaven and reject the earth. Such as
      life is you have to take it.

      And you have to live it. The huge machinery of Society is on your hands,
      with all its infinite complications, its infinite possibilities of beauty
      and joy. Your life is, as ever, a sacrifice; all life is, as ever, a
      sacrifice; but it is a sacrifice to man&mdash;a sacrifice to the best.
      Once your task was self-abnegation, and that was easy; now it is
      self-assertion, and that is hard. Knowing what you are, you will dare to
      live, not for your own sake, but that strength and beauty may be in the
      world. Knowing what you might be, you choose infinite toil for your
      portion, and in the humility of toil you find your holiest peace. Your
      enemy you resist with all your soul, not for hatred of your enemy, but for
      love of the right. If he were not evil he could not be your enemy; and
      being evil, he has no right to be. Your conscience to you is no longer a
      shame, but a joy; you think no more of infinite sin, but of infinite
      virtue.&mdash;And for the rest, you do not attain perfection, and you are
      not worshiped as a god; you are much troubled by trivialities, and the
      battle tries your soul. But you make no truce with lies, and you never lay
      down your sword; you keep your eyes upon a far goal, and you leave the
      world better than you found it. When you come to die you have no fear, but
      a song; for you are master of yourself, and you have learned to know that
      which you are.

      Has any one, at this end of the nineteenth century, a clear idea of what
      the poets of the ages called <i>Inspiration</i>? If no one have, I will
      describe it. With the least remainder of superstition in him a man would
      scarcely be able to put aside the idea that he was merely the Incarnation,
      the mouthpiece, the medium of overwhelming powers. The idea of Revelation
      in the mind describes exactly the state of affairs&mdash;that suddenly,
      with unspeakable certainty and fineness, something became visible and
      audible, something that shakes and pervades one to the depths. One hears&mdash;he
      does not seek; he takes&mdash;he does not ask who gives; like lightning
      gleams out a thought, of necessity, formed without hesitation&mdash;I have
      never had a choice. An ecstasy, whose colossal strain breaks in the middle
      with a stream of tears, in the course of which the step becomes,
      involuntary, now raging, now slow; a state in which one is completely
      beside himself, with the distinctest consciousness of countless
      shudderings and quiverings, even to the toes of his feet; a depth of joy
      in which all that is painful and somber serves, not as a contrast, but as
      conditioned, as demanded, as a necessary color in such an overflow of
      light; an instinct of rhythmic relations which overleaps vast spaces of
      forms; all happening in the highest degree involuntarily, but as if in a
      storm of sensations of freedom, of infinity, of power, of divinity.&mdash;This
      is my experience of Inspiration; I doubt not but that one must needs go
      back thousands of years to find one who might say, &ldquo;It is also mine.&rdquo;

      When Zarathustra came into the next city, which lay beside the forest, he
      found in that place much people gathered together in the market; for they
      had been called that they should see a rope-dancer. And Zarathustra spoke
      thus unto the people:
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>&ldquo;I teach ye the Over-man.</i> The man is something who shall be
      overcome. What have ye done to overcome him?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All being before this made something beyond itself: and you will be the
      ebb of this great flood, and rather go back to the beast than overcome the
      man?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the ape to the man? A mockery or a painful shame. And even so
      shall man be to the Over-man: a mockery or a painful shame.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Man is a cord, tied between Beast and Over-man&mdash;a cord above an
      abyss.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A perilous arriving, a perilous traveling, a perilous looking backward, a
      perilous trembling and standing still.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is great in man is that he is a bridge, and no goal; what can be
      loved in man is that he is a going-over and a going-under.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I love them that know not how to live, be it even as those going under,
      for such are those going across.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I love them that are great in scorn, because these are they that are
      great in reverence, and <i>arrows of longing toward the other shore!&rdquo;</i>

      To-day it snowed hard, and it occurred to me that I might add to my money.
      I bought a second-hand shovel and went out to shovel snow. It is not so
      bad, I said, you are out of doors, and also you can think of Nietzsche.
    </p>
    <p>
      I made a dollar and a half, but I fear I did not think very much. My hands
      were cold, for one thing, and my shoes thin, for another.

    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      There is nothing that brings me down like physical toil. It is madness to
      believe that you can do anything else&mdash;you drudge and drudge, and
      your mind is an absolute blank while you do it. It is a thing that sets me
      wild with nervousness and impatience. I hate it! I hate it!
    </p>
    <p>
      And I find myself crying out and protesting against it; and then I see
      other men not minding it, and I hear the words of my dear clergyman
      friend: &ldquo;The labor which all of us have to share.&rdquo; So I say to myself:
      Perhaps I am really an idler then! A poor unhappy fool that can not face
      life's sternness, that is crying out to escape his duty!

<pre xml:space="preserve">
  A vapor, heavy, hueless, formless, cold!
</pre>
    <p>
      Leave it to time! Leave it to time!
    </p>
    <p>
      &mdash;I hear that, and I hear around me the laughter of mocking demons.
      It startles my soul&mdash;but no longer to rage as it used to. I sit and
      stare at it with a great, heavy numbness possessing me.

      I am still reading Nietzsche. I think I shall read all that he has
      written. I am always kept aware of the limitations, but he is a tremendous
      man. Can you guess how this took hold of me?&mdash;

      THE GRAVE-SONG
    </h3>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There lies the island of graves, the silent; there are also the graves of
      my youth. Thither will I carry an evergreen wreath of life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus resolving in my heart, I went over the sea.&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh ye visions and apparitions of my youth! Oh all ye glances of love, ye
      godlike moments! How swiftly you died in me! I remember you to-day as my
      dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      From you, my dearest dead, there comes to me a sweet odor, heart-melting,
      tear-melting. Truly it shakes and melts the heart of the lonely seaman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still am I the richest and the most to be envied&mdash;I, the most lonely.
      For I <i>had</i> you, and you have me still; say, to whom fell, as to me,
      such rose-apples from the trees?...
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Me</i> to kill, they strangled you, you song-birds of my hopes. Yea, at
      you, the dearest, shot wickedness its arrows&mdash;to strike my heart!...
    </p>
    <p>
      This word will I speak to my enemies: &ldquo;What is all murder of man beside
      that which ye did to me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus, in the good hour, spake my purity: &ldquo;Godlike shall all being be to
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then ye fell upon me with your foul spirits; ah, whither now hath the good
      hour fled?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All days shall be holy to me&rdquo;&mdash;so spake once the wisdom of my youth;
      truly the speech of a happy wisdom.
    </p>
    <p>
      But then you enemies stole away my nights and sold them to sleepless
      torment; ah, whither now hath the happy wisdom fled?...
    </p>
    <p>
      As a blind man once I went a blissful way; then you threw rubbish in the
      blind man's way; and now he is weary of the old blind ascendings....
    </p>
    <p>
      And once would I dance as never had I danced before; above all the heavens
      away would I dance. And then you lured away my dearest singer!...
    </p>
    <p>
      Only in the dance can I speak metaphors of the highest things:&mdash;and
      now my highest metaphor remained unspoken in my limbs!
    </p>
    <p>
      Unspoken and undelivered remained my highest hope! And there died all the
      visions and solaces of my youth!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      That thing brought the tears down my cheeks. It is what my soul has cried
      all day and all night&mdash;that I see all my joy and all my beauty going!
    </p>
    <p>
      It is the fearful, the agonizing <i>waiting</i> that does it. I know it&mdash;I
      put it down&mdash;there is nothing kills the soul in a man so much as
      that. When you wait your life is outside of yourself; you hope,&mdash;you
      are at the mercy of others&mdash;at the mercy of indifference and accident
      and God knows what.
    </p>
    <p>
      But again I cry, &ldquo;What can I do? If there is anything I have not done&mdash;tell
      me! Tell me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here I sit, and I have but seven dollars left to my name, including what I
      made by the shoveling. And I sit and watch the day creep on me like a wild
      beast on its prey&mdash;the day when I must go back into the world and
      toil again! Oh, it will kill me&mdash;it will kill me!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      I sit and wait and hang upon the faint chance of one publisher more. It is
      my only chance,&mdash;and such a chance! I find myself calculating,
      wondering; yes, famous books have been rejected often, and still found
      their mark. Can I still believe that this book will shake men?
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah, God, in my soul I do not believe it, because I have lost my
      inspiration! I have let go of that fire that was to drive like a
      wind-storm over the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, I ask myself if such things can be! I ask myself if they were real,
      all those fervors and all that boldness of mine! If it was natural, that
      way that lived!
    </p>
    <p>
      &mdash;Oh, and then I look back, and my heart grows sick within me.
    </p>

    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      So I spend my time, and when I turn and try to lose myself in Nietzsche,
      his mercilessness flings me into new despair.

    <p>
      I have the terrible gift of insensibility; and I think my insensibility
      torments me more than anything else in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have no life, no power, no feeling, naturally&mdash;it is all my will,
      it is all effort. And now that I am not striving, I sink back into a state
      of numbness, of dull, insensible despair. I no longer feel anything, I no
      longer care about anything. I pass my time in helpless impotence&mdash;and
      day by day I watch a thing creeping upon me as in a nightmare. I must go
      out into the world again and slave for my bread!
    </p>

    <p>
      I have stopped reading Nietzsche. I could not stand any more of it. It
      does not satisfy me.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not merely that I am so weak now, and that his mocking goads me. I
      would have been through with him in any case. He is so narrow&mdash;so
      one-sided.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is reaction from the present, of course, that accounts for it. Too much
      gazing upon the world, that has led him to believe that love of man
      necessarily implies compromise.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are two words that are absent from his writings&mdash;they are love
      and humanity; and so it never satisfies you, you are always discontented,
      you have always to correct and supply.
    </p>
    <p>

      January 22d.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh why do those publishers take so long! I wait and yearn; I grow sick
      with waiting and yearning.
    </p>
    <p>
      I never allowed any weakness in my soul before; I never made any terms
      with it. I blamed everything upon myself. And now that my whole life is
      weakness and misery, I writhe and struggle&mdash;I turn back always on
      myself, suspecting myself, blaming myself. I can not lay it to the world,
      I can not get into the habit&mdash;it is such a miserable habit! How many
      millions there are of them&mdash;poor, querulous wretches, blaming their
      fate, crying out against the world's injustice and neglect&mdash;crying
      out against the need of working, wishing for this and that&mdash;discontented,
      impotent, miserable! Oh my God&mdash;and I am one of such!
    </p>
    <p>
      I can not bear the sound of my own voice when I complain! I hear the world
      answering me&mdash;and I take the part of the world! &ldquo;Why don't you be a
      man and go out and earn your way? Why don't you face your fate? You prate
      about your message&mdash;what business has a man with a message that is
      too much for him? What business have you with weakness&mdash;what <i>excuse</i>
      have you for weakness?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And so I came to see it. The world is right and I am all wrong! And the
      truth of it burns me like an acid in my brain.

      And all the time my whole being is still restless with the storms that

      can not realize it&mdash;any of what I was and had&mdash;but I know it as
      a <i>fact</i>, a memory, and I crouch and tremble, I grow sick with it.

      The reason that I shudder so at the prospect of having to face the world
      again, is that I have no hope. <i>I have no hope!</i> Once I could go out
      into that hellish market. I could be any man's slave, do any drudgery&mdash;because
      I saw a light ahead&mdash;I saw deliverance&mdash;I had a purpose!
    </p>
    <p>
      And now what purpose have I&mdash;what hope have I? I tell you I am a man
      in a trap! I can do nothing! I can do no more than if I were walled in
      with iron!
    </p>
    <p>
      I say that my business in this world is to be a poet! I say that there is
      only one thing I can do&mdash;only one way that I can get free&mdash;and
      that is by doing my work, by writing books. And I have done all that I can
      do, I have earned my freedom&mdash;and no one will give it to me! Oh, I
      shall die if I am penned here much longer!

      would take it and shout it from the housetops&mdash;I would peddle it on
      the streets&mdash;I would <i>make</i> the world hear me!

      Some more snow. My hands were nearly frost-bitten, but I keep at it; for
      at least it is out in the air, and it gives me a little longer respite.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the afternoon I made up my mind to go and see the publishers and ask
      them if they could not read the story at once&mdash;it has been a month. I
      saw their literary manager; he said he was going to read it himself.

      They regret, of course, and hold the MS. at my disposal. I went up to get
      it this afternoon, and half by accident I met the man I had seen before. I
      had a talk with him. He was a very curious personage.
    </p>
    <p>
      He seemed to have been interested in The Captive. &ldquo;I'll tell you,&rdquo; he
      said, &ldquo;you know there's really some extraordinary work in that poem. I
      believe that you have it in you to make some literature before you get
      through, Mr. Stirling.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you?&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;I feel pretty sure of it. You ask me to tell you about
      it&mdash;so you mustn't mind if I speak frankly. And of course it's very
      crude. You haven't found your voice yet, you're seeking for mastery, and
      your work is obviously young. Anybody can see in a few lines that it's
      young&mdash;it's one of those things like Goetz von Berlichingen, or Die
      Räuber&mdash;you tear a passion to tatters, you want to rip the universe
      up the back. But of course that wears off by and by; it isn't well to take
      life too seriously, you know, and I don't think it'll be long before you
      come to feel that The Captive isn't natural or possible&mdash;or desirable
      either.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The publisher was smoking a cigar. He puffed for a moment and then he
      asked, &ldquo;What are you doing now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing just at present,&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should have supposed you'd be writing another poem,&rdquo; he replied,&mdash;&ldquo;though
      of course as a matter of fact the wisest thing you can do is to wait and
      learn. Your next book will be entirely different, you can be quite sure&mdash;you
      won't be so anxious to get hold of all the world and make it go your way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I smiled feebly. &ldquo;Possibly not,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll tell you a story,&rdquo; said the publisher&mdash;&ldquo;speaking about youthful
      aspirations! I was talking to Mr. X&mdash;&mdash; last night, the author
      of &mdash;&mdash;. [Footnote: The manuscript names an extremely popular
      historical novel.] You wouldn't think X&mdash;&mdash; was the sort of man
      to be reforming the world, would you? But he told me about his earliest
      work, that he said he had tucked away in a drawer, and it turned out he
      was like all other authors. This was a socialist story, it seems, and the
      hero delivered fiery speeches six pages long. And X&mdash;&mdash; said
      that he had written it and taken it to a publisher, expecting to upset the
      world a week after it appeared, but that he never could get anybody to
      publish it, and gave it up finally and went into journalism. The funny
      part of it was that he had sent it here, and when he told me about it, I
      remembered looking it over and writing him just about what I'm telling
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The publisher smoked for a moment or two. &ldquo;You see, Mr. Stirling,&rdquo; he said
      at last, &ldquo;he had to wait ten years before he 'arrived.' So you must not be
      discouraged. Have you read his book?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I have not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a very pretty piece of work&mdash;it's been many months since it
      came out, but they say it's still selling in the thousands. Don't get
      discouraged, Mr. Stirling, keep at it, because you have real talent, I
      assure you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I rose to go, and he shook my hand. &ldquo;Take my advice,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and write
      something more practicable than a tragedy. But of course don't forget in
      any case that we shall always be very happy to read anything of yours at
      any time.&rdquo;
     </p>

      &mdash;I walked down the street meditating. I will get over it again, of
      course; but to-night I sat in the dark and the cold, shivering. And I
      asked myself if it must not be so after all. &ldquo;<i>Is</i> it true, the thing
      that I did; is it <i>natural</i>?&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Or must it not be exaggerated
      and crude, as they all tell me! And uninteresting!&mdash;What is the use
      of it? I tormented myself that way and tore myself to pieces, but it does
      not stir any one else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ah, of course it's all dead in me&mdash;and I'm prepared to believe
      anything they tell me! It's overwrought, it's young, it's pitched in too
      high a key, it's strained and unnatural, it takes life too seriously!
      Certainly at any rate they are right that I shall never, never do the same
      thing again.
    </p>
    <p>
      But unfortunately I don't feel like writing anything else. I don't know
      anything about historical novels.

      &mdash;I would have read some of the poem again to-night, but I'm too
      discouraged. I am tired of it. I know it by heart, and it doesn't take
      hold of me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have been too long among men, I groan. I see their point of view too
      well!
    </p>
    <p>
      Why, there are things in that book that when I read them now make me
      shudder. I have hardly the courage to offer it to any one else to read. I
      don't know any one to take it to, besides.

      February 3d.
    </p>
    <p>
      To-day an idea occurred to me, one that should have occurred before. Once
      upon a time I was introduced to the editor of the &mdash;&mdash;. Perhaps
      he will not remember it, I said. But anyhow, why not try? I will take him
      The Captive&mdash;perhaps he can use it in the magazine&mdash;who knows?
    </p>
    <p>
      I knew nothing better to do, so I went there. He was very polite&mdash;he
      did remember my face. He was fearfully busy, it seemed. He did not think
      there was much likelihood of a magazine's publishing a blank-verse
      tragedy; but I told him how I had worked, and he said he'd read it.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so there's one chance more!
    </p>
    <p>
      My poor, foolish heart is always ready to tremble with new hope. But faith
      in that book was so <i>ground</i> into it!
    </p>
    <p>
      &mdash;I asked him to read it at once, I explained that I was in great
      haste. I think he understood what I meant. My clothes show it.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have been hoarding my money&mdash;counting every cent. I dread the world
      so! Now that I am so broken, so laden with misery, it sounds about me as
      one jeer of mockery. But I shall have to be hunting a place soon&mdash;you
      never can tell how long it may take you, and the chances are so terrible.
    </p>
    <p>
      I will not do anything until I hear from this one man, however. He
      promised to let me know in a week.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      I did not see him at the publisher's&mdash;he has another office besides.
      He had huge piles of papers and books about him; he is an important man, I
      guess; can it be that he will be the one to save me?
    </p>
    <p>
      I think: &ldquo;Oh if he knew, he would!&rdquo; I find myself thinking that of all the
      world&mdash;if I could only make them understand! Poor, impotent wretch,
      if I could only find the <i>word</i>!
    </p>
    <p>
      &mdash;Or is it simply my blind egotism that makes me think that?

      February 6th.
    </p>
    <p>
      I do not think that what I write can be of much interest. It must be
      monotonous&mdash;all this despair, this endless crying out, this endless
      repetition of the same words, the same thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet that is all that my life is! That is just what I do every day&mdash;whenever
      I am not reading a book to forget myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is all so simple, my situation! That is the most terrible thing about
      it, it is the same thing always and forever.

      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      I have lived so much agony through this thing&mdash;it would not startle
      me if I saw that my hair had turned white. I know I feel like an old man.
      I am settled down into mournfulness, into despair; I can do nothing but
      gaze back&mdash;I have lived my life&mdash;I have spent my force&mdash;I
      am tired and sick.
    </p>
    <p>
      I! I! I!&mdash;do you get tired of hearing it? It was not always like
      that; once you read a little about a book.

    <p>
      This is the fifth day. I am counting the days, I have been counting the
      very hours. He said he would be a week. And I&mdash;only think of it&mdash;I
      have but two dollars and sixty cents left!
    </p>
    <p>
      Hurry up! Hurry up!
    </p>
    <p>
      &mdash;And then I say with considerable scorn in my voice: &ldquo;Haven't you
      learned enough about that manuscript yet? And about publishers yet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />

    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      February 10th.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just imagine! I went to see him to-day, and he stared at me. &ldquo;Why, sure
      enough, Mr. Stirling!&mdash;It had slipped my mind entirely!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I have learned to bear things. I asked him calmly to let me know as soon
      as possible. He said: &ldquo;I am honestly so rushed that I do not know where to
      turn. But I will do the best I possibly can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I said&mdash;poor, pitiful cringing, is it not terrible?&mdash;that I'd be
      up his way again in three days, and did he think he could have it read by
      then. He said he was not sure, but that he'd try.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so I went away. Now I have two dollars and twenty-three cents. I have
      to pay my rent to-morrow, and that will leave me a dollar and a half. I
      can make that do me seven or eight days&mdash;I have one or two things at
      home. I'll wait the three days&mdash;and then I'll have to set out in
      earnest to find something to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, the horror of not knowing if you can pay your next week's room rent in
      this fearful city!
    </p>
    <p>

      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      February 11th.
    </p>
    <p>
      I sat and looked at myself to-day. I said: &ldquo;When a soul is crushed like
      this, can it ever get up again? Can it ever be the same, no matter what
      happens? Don't you see the fact, that you've been tamed and broken&mdash;that
      you've <i>given in</i>! And how will you ever rise from the shame of it,
      how will you ever forget it? All this skulking and trembling&mdash;how
      will you ever dare look yourself in the face again! Will not it mock your
      every effort? Why, you poor wretch, <i>you've got a broken back!&rdquo;</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      February 12th.
    </p>
    <p>
      And to-morrow again I must go there, trembling and nervous, hanging on a
      word!
    </p>
    <p>
      There is not much sense in it, but I have learned to hate all men who have
      ease and power.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      February 13th.
    </p>
    <p>
      I knew it! I could have told it beforehand. &ldquo;I am awfully sorry, Mr.
      Stirling, but it is no use talking, I simply can not! I will write you
      just as soon as ever I get it read.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And so I came out. I had a dollar and twenty cents. My rent would be due
      in four days again. So even if I got some work at once I should have to
      pawn something.
    </p>
    <p>
      &mdash;Thus I began my search for a situation. I could not choose&mdash;I
      was willing to take anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      I fear I look like a tramp; but I have several letters from places where I
      have worked. Still, I could not find anything. I have tramped all day
      until I could hardly move. I bought a paper, but everything advertised was
      gone by that time.
    </p>
    <p>
      If it would only snow again, so that I could shovel some more!

      February 14th.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again I have been pacing the streets the whole endless day, beaten back
      and rebuffed at every turn. I have been drilled for this, this is the
      climax! First take every gleam of heart out of me, and then set me to
      pacing the streets in the cold, to be stared at and insulted by every kind
      of a man!
    </p>
    <p>
      And still nothing to do.

      February 15th.
    </p>
    <p>
      I take my lunch with me&mdash;I have cut myself down to twenty cents a day
      for food. I walk and walk, and I am so hungry I can not do on less than
      that. I have but sixty cents left to-night. I failed again to-day.
    </p>

      February 16th.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not as desperate as it sounds, because I have a few books and things
      that I can sell&mdash;I do not believe that I will actually starve&mdash;I
      have always done my work well, and have gotten references. But O God, the
      shame of it&mdash;the endless, heaped-up bitterness!
    </p>
    <p>
      I have sunk into a beast of burden. I trudge on with my mind torpid&mdash;I
      take whatever comes to me, and go on mechanically. Oh it cows me, it wears
      me down! I have learned to bear anything&mdash;<i>anything</i>! A man
      might kick me and I would not mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      I think I went to fifty places yesterday. Nothing to do&mdash;nothing.
      To-day is Sunday, but I tried even to-day. I came home to get some dinner.&mdash;I
      might have been a porter in a hotel, and carried trunks&mdash;that was my
      one chance. But I have not the physical power for that.
    </p>
    <p>
      &mdash;And then after all&mdash;toward evening&mdash;when I was so tired I
      was almost wild&mdash;I had an offer at last! And guess what it was&mdash;of
      all the things that I had made up my mind I could not bear&mdash;to be a
      waiter!
    </p>
    <p>
      It is, I believe, what a man should call a rare opportunity. It is a
      fairly good restaurant just off Broadway; and I get ten dollars and tips.
      Poor me! My heart bounded for a moment, and then I asked myself, And what
      do you want with money any more? I took the place, and I am to begin the
      day after to-morrow. I am so tired I can hardly move.

      Was it not irony? I have watched day by day for snow; and now that I have
      taken the other place&mdash;behold, to-day it snows a foot!
    </p>
    <p>
      &mdash;I went to see the editor in the afternoon. I was desperate at the
      thought of to-morrow. I said I would tell him!&mdash;But when I got there
      I only had the courage to inquire about the poem. He had not read it. I
      feared he seemed annoyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      I shall not go there again for a week. I can not make him hurry.

    </p>
    <p>
      To-day I had to begin by apologizing to my landlady, and begging her to
      let me pay her a week later. I had to go into an elaborate explanation&mdash;she
      wanted to know why I had not been working all these months, and so on. She
      has a red face, and drinks, I think.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then I had to take a load of my best books&mdash;my poor, few precious
      books that I have loved&mdash;and sell them at a second-hand bookstore.
      When I had sold them I had to hire a waiter's suit for a week, until I had
      money to buy it. And then with that awful thing on I went down to the
      restaurant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Can you imagine how a pure woman would feel if she had to go into a
      brothel to live? That was just how I felt&mdash;just how! Oh my God, the
      indignity of it! Is there <i>anything</i> that I could do more
      humiliating?
    </p>
    <p>
      &mdash;But I have lost the power of getting angry. Only my heart is one
      great sob.

      Oh, that hellish place! What is there in this whole city more brutal than
      that restaurant?
    </p>
    <p>
      Day and night, day and night, to see but one thing&mdash;to see flashy,
      overdressed, fat and vulgar men and women gorging themselves! Oh, this
      will teach me to feel&mdash;this at least! I go about with my whole being
      one curse of rage&mdash;I could throttle them! And to bow and smirk and
      lackey them&mdash;all day! All day! Oh, what shall I do&mdash;how shall I
      bear it?
    </p>
    <p>
      They offer me tips. At first I thought I should refuse; but no, I dare not
      do that, even if I wanted to. And since I have stooped to do it, I will
      take all I can get. To get money is my one passion now. Oh my God, how can
      I bear it!

      can not let myself go to wreck in this fashion&mdash;<i>I've got to fight!</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      And so I got my note-book; and I fell to work to drive myself as of old.
      The effort that it cost me made me ill, but I did it. I shall keep on
      doing it&mdash;I am like a man faced by a fiend&mdash;I <i>must</i> keep
      on&mdash;I must!

    <p>

      Oh, one can get used to even a flashy restaurant! It is your fate&mdash;you
      take it. This is how I pass all my time there. I struggle to resist the
      deadening of it, and the horror of it; while I am going about the
      loathsome grind I try to think&mdash;try to have some idea in my head. And
      something comes to me&mdash;something beautiful, perhaps; and then in a
      few moments, in the clatter and confusion, I lose it; and after that I go
      about haunted, restless, feeling that I have lost something, that I ought
      to be doing something. What the thing is, I do not even know&mdash;but so
      it drives me and drives me!

      There is another torment about this fearful place that I am in, one that
      you could not imagine. I had thought that it would be a pleasure, but it
      tears my soul. They have music in the evening; and fancy a person in my
      state listening to a violin!
    </p>
    <p>
      Chiefly, of course, they play trash; but sometimes there comes something
      beautiful, perhaps only a phrase. But it takes hold of my soul, it makes
      my eyes grow dim, it makes me shudder. It is all my pent-up agony, it is
      all my sleeping passion&mdash;why, it overwhelms me! And I am helpless&mdash;I
      can not get away from it!
    </p>
    <p>
      Remember that I have not heard any music for a year. It is like the voice
      of a dead love to me. I thought to-night that I could not bear it.

    </p>
    <p>
      To-day I had a day off, and I went to see the editor. I have been waiting,
      day by day, for a letter; it has been a month since I left it with him,
      and I found that he had not read it yet!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Stirling,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it is not my fault, it has simply been
      impossible. Now I will tell you what to do. I am going out of the city
      Sunday week, and I shall have a little leisure then. I do not see how I
      can get to it before that, so you take it and see if you can find some one
      else to read it meanwhile. If you will bring it to me Saturday, a week
      from to-day, I will promise you faithfully to read it on Sunday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So I took the manuscript. I tried four publishing houses, but I could not
      find one that would read it in a week. I had to take the manuscript home.

      March 3d.

    <p>
      To-morrow ends my second week at the restaurant. It took me five days to
      find that place, but I am going to give it up to-morrow. I could not bear
      it, if it were to save my life. I can not bear the noise and the grease
      and the dirt, and the endless, endless vulgarity; but above all I can not
      bear the music.
    </p>
    <p>
      I can bear almost any degradation, I have found; but not when I have to
      listen to music!
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides, I can afford to give it up. I have made a fortune. I shall have
      over thirty dollars when I leave!
    </p>

    <p>
      I have always been paid, I find, in proportion to the indignities I bore&mdash;in
      proportion to the amount I humiliated myself before the rich and the
      vulgar. These vile, bejeweled, befeathered women, these loathsome, swinish
      men&mdash;<i>these</i> are the people who have money to spend. They go
      through the world scattering their largess with royal hand; and you can
      get down and gather it up out of the mud beneath their feet.
    </p>

    </p>
    <p>
      I come home at night worn out and weak, sometimes almost in a stupor; but
      I am never too ill to brood over that hideous state of affairs. I gaze at
      it and I wring my hands, and I cry: Oh my Father in heaven, will it always
      be like this?
    </p>
    <p>
      Think of it&mdash;this money that these people squander&mdash;do you know
      what it is? It is the toil of society! That is what it is,&mdash;it is <i>my</i>
      toil&mdash;it is the toil of the millions that swarm in the tenements
      where I live&mdash;it is the toil of the laborers, the beasts of burden of
      society, in the cities and in the country.
    </p>
    <p>
      Think about it, I cry, think about it!&mdash;Can I not find any word, is
      there nothing I can do or say now or at any time, to make men see it? Why,
      you take it for granted&mdash;<i>I</i> have taken it for granted all my
      days&mdash;that money should belong to the brutal rich to squander in
      whatever inanity may please them! But it never dawns upon you that this
      money is <i>the toil of the human race</i>! Money is the representation of
      all that human toil creates&mdash;of all <i>value</i>; it is houses that
      laborers build, it is grain that farmers raise, it is books that poets
      write! And see what becomes of it&mdash;see! <i>see</i>! Or are you blind
      or mad, that you <i>will</i> not see? Have you no more faith in man, no
      more care about the soul?

      You think that I have been made sick by my work in that one haunt of vice.
      But it is not only that, it is not only that fever district where all the
      diseases of a city gather. I have been all <i>over</i> the city, and it is
      everywhere the same. Go to the opera-house any night and you may see
      blasphemous vanity enough to feed the starving of this city for a year.
      Walk up Fifth Avenue and see them driving; or go to Newport and see them
      there. Why, I read in the papers once of a woman who gave a ball&mdash;and
      the little fact has stuck in my mind ever since that she wore a dress
      trimmed with lace that cost a thousand dollars a meter! I do not speak of
      the infinite vulgarity of the thing&mdash;it is the monstrous <i>crime</i>
      of it that cries to me. These people&mdash;why, they have society by the
      <i>throat</i>!

    <p>
      I bury my face in my pillow and sob; but then I look up and pray for
      faith. I say we are only at the beginning of civilization, we can see but
      the first gleams of a social conscience; but it will come&mdash;it must
      come! Am I to believe that mankind will always submit to toil and pant to
      make lace at a thousand dollars a meter to cover the pride-swollen carcase
      of a society dame?

    <p>
      How is it to be managed? I do not know. I am not a political economist&mdash;I
      am a seeker after righteousness. But as a poet, and as a clear-eyed soul,
      I stand upon the heights and I cry out for it, I demand it. I demand that
      society shall come to its own, I demand that there shall be intelligence
      in the world! I demand that the toil of the millions shall not be for the
      pride of the few! I demand that it shall not be to buy diamonds and
      dresses and banquets, horses and carriages, palaces and yachts! I demand
      that it shall be for the making of knowledge and power, of beauty and
      light and love!

    <p>
      Oh, thou black jungle of a world!&mdash;What know you of knowledge and
      power, of beauty and light and love? What do you dream of these things?
      The end of man as you know it is to fight and struggle like a maniac, and
      grab for his own all that he can lay his claws upon. And what is your
      social ideal&mdash;but to lavish, each man upon himself, all that he can
      lavish before he dies? And whom do you honor save him who succeeds in
      that? And whom do you scorn save him who fails?

    <p>
      I sit alone and think of these things, until my breath comes hard with
      rage. I say: &ldquo;It is these that I serve&mdash;it is these who own the
      fruits of my toil&mdash;it is these for whom I am starved and crushed&mdash;it
      is these by whom my God-given power is trampled into annihilation!&rdquo;

    <p>
      I gave the place up this morning. I have thirty-one dollars. I think such
      a sum of money never made me less happy.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have nothing to do but drag myself back to my room and wait there until
      the eighth, to take back my manuscript. It will be five weeks that he has
      kept me&mdash;I suppose that is not his fault.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then I say: &ldquo;Fool, to torment yourself with such hopes! Don't you <i>know</i>
      that he will say what all the rest have said? He is a clever man, and he
      knows everything; but what use is he going to have for your poetry?&rdquo;

    <p>
      I wandered about almost all of to-day, or sat stupid in my room. I have
      lost all my habits of effort&mdash;I have forgotten all that I ever knew,
      all my hopes, all my plans. I said: &ldquo;I will study!&rdquo; But then I added: &ldquo;Why
      should I? Shall I not only make myself miserable, get myself full of
      emotion, and to no purpose but the carrying of dishes?&rdquo;

    <p>
      It is terrible to me to have to acknowledge any change in my way of living&mdash;I
      never did that before. Compromises! Concessions! Surrenders!&mdash;words
      such as those set me mad. But what am I to do? What <i>can</i> I do? I
      writhe and twist, but there is no escape. I struggle upward, but I am only
      beaten back and back? How should I not stop striving?

      Circumstances made no difference to a man. So I used to prate!
    </p>
    <p>
      No difference! Why, I was a giant in my soul, swift and terrible as the
      lion. I leaped upon my task, I seized upon everything that came my way. I
      passed whole classes of men at a bound, I saw, I felt&mdash;I bore the
      world in my soul. I would dare everything, learn everything, live
      everything&mdash;take it all into myself. And every day I was stronger,
      every day I was more!&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      And now see me! You have penned me here, you have starved me, stunted me,
      crushed me&mdash;I sit shivering and staring at my own piteousness! Why, I
      can not even be angry any more&mdash;I am too shrunken, too impotent for
      that! And was it my fault? Have I not fought till I was ill?
    </p>
    <p>
      &mdash;But never did I put forth a hope that it was not withered in the
      bud! My every enthusiasm you stamped into the ground; every advance that I
      made&mdash;why you smote me in the face! And all my ardor, my confidence,
      my trust&mdash;has it ever met with anything but jeers?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      &mdash;Yes, and now you turn away&mdash;this revolts you! This is bare,
      painful egotism&mdash;this is whining&mdash;this is querulous misery. It
      offends you like the sight of raw flesh!
    </p>
    <p>
      &mdash;It is my raw soul. My poor little naked, pitiful, beaten soul!&mdash;groveling,
      and begging, too!

    <p>
      &mdash;But whose fault is it&mdash;merciful Heaven, whose fault is it? It
      is my nature to live in myself&mdash;to live from myself. And this that is
      unbearable egotism, why, it would have been exulting power! Joy in a
      vision! Mastery of a life and an art!
    </p>
    <p>
      But here you shut me up! You crush me down! I try to escape&mdash;I cry
      out: &ldquo;I am <i>not</i> an egotist&mdash;I am a worshiper! I want nothing in
      the world so much as to forget myself&mdash;my rights, my claims, my
      powers, my talents! I want to think of God! Only give me a chance&mdash;only
      give me a chance to do that, and I care not what you do with me! Here I
      stand with my poor little work, begging, pleading for some one to heed it!
      Thinking of it only, living for it only, insisting upon it day and night!
      But do you think that I do that of choice? My God, no&mdash;you are mad&mdash;I
      only want to go on! Give me but the chance to go on&mdash;and do you think
      that I would care whether any man admired my work?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &mdash;Why, I would not even know it&mdash;I would be out in the mountains
      alone!

      Sinking down! Sinking down! To see yourself one of the losing creatures,
      to know that there is no help for you in this world&mdash;that no one will

      weakness, to see yourself as everything that you hate&mdash;to be mad with

      My vision, my life, my joy, my fire! These are the things that are dying!
      And when the soul is dead do you think that I shall care about the body?

      To-day I shook myself together. I could not stand such wretchedness. I
      said, I will get a novel, and I will put myself into it&mdash;grimly&mdash;I
      will read in spite of everything.

      And such a book as I lighted on by chance!&mdash;Once I had whole yawning
      vistas of books toward which I stretched out my arms; but somehow I had
      forgotten them all to-day. I could do no better than pick up a book by
      chance.&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      I picked up Tess of the D'Urbervilles, and I found myself in the midst of
      the same misery that haunts me here. I read it, but it did not help me.

    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      &mdash;It is strange what poverty has ground into my soul. I find myself
      reading such a book with but one feeling, one idea crying out in me. I
      discover that my whole being is reduced to the great elemental, primitive
      instinct of self-preservation. Love is dead in me, generosity, humanity,
      imagination is dead,&mdash;everything but one wild-beast passion; and I
      find myself panting as I read: &ldquo;Get some money! Get some money! Hold on to
      it!&rdquo;

      March 7th.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tess of the D'Urbervilles is one of the most unconvincing books I ever
      read. I neither believed in it nor cared about it in the slightest.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am shown a &ldquo;pure woman,&rdquo; and by and by I learn, to my perplexity, that
      she has been seduced; after which she continues the &ldquo;pure woman&rdquo; again,
      and I am asked to agonize over her troubles! But all the time I keep
      saying, &ldquo;This is not a woman that you are showing me at all&mdash;a woman
      with a soul; it is a puppet figure that you suppose 'seduced' for the sake
      of the story.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It is our absurd English ideas of &ldquo;propriety&rdquo; that make possible such
      things. If the author had had to show the seduction of &ldquo;Tess&rdquo; the weakness
      of the thing would have been plain in an instant. That he did not show it
      was his lack of conscience. There is no propriety in art but truth.

      Monday.
    </p>
    <p>
      Deep in my soul I can have no more disappointments about it. I take it
      about from habit. I sat and looked it over last night, but one can not
      read emotional things in cold blood. I said, Is this true? Is it natural?
      Is there any <i>use</i> in it?
    </p>
    <p>
      I was tempted to cut out one or two things; but I decided to let it stay
      as it was.

      I have been sitting to-night in my room, half-dazed, or pacing about the

      true, I can hardly realize it! I laugh with excitement, and then I cry.

      I went to-day to get back my manuscript. And the editor said: &ldquo;Mr.
      Stirling, it is a most extraordinary piece of work. It is a most
      interesting thing, I like it very much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I stared at him gasping. Then I waited to hear him say&mdash;&ldquo;But I
      regret&rdquo;&mdash;But he didn't!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't tell you anything definite about it,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I want to submit
      it to the firm. I wouldn't undertake to accept any such unusual thing for
      the magazine without consulting them, and especially seeing if they will
      bring it out afterward&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are thinking of using it in the magazine!&rdquo; I cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As I tell you, I can't say positively. I can only tell you what I think
      of it. I will have them read it at once&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will take it to them to-day!&rdquo; I put in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you need not, for I am going there this afternoon, and I
      will take it, and ask them to read it immediately.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I can't remember what else he said. I was deaf, crazy! I rushed home,
      talking to myself incoherently. I remember sitting here in a chair and
      saying aloud, &ldquo;Oh, it can't be! It is impossible! That it should be good
      enough to publish in a magazine like that! It is some mistake&mdash;it
      will all come to nothing. It's absurd!&rdquo;

    <p>

    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      So I sat, and I thought what such a thing would mean to me&mdash;it would
      make my reputation in a day&mdash;I should be free&mdash;<i>free</i>! But
      I thought of it and it did not make me happy; I only sat staring at
      myself, shuddering. The endless mournfulness that is in my heart surged up
      in me like a tide, and suddenly I began to cry like a child.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has come to me too late,&rdquo; I exclaimed, &ldquo;too late! I can't believe it&mdash;it
      doesn't mean anything to me. I don't care anything about it&mdash;I mean
      the poem! <i>I don't believe in it myself</i>!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      God, do you know I said that, and <i>meant</i> it? I said more&mdash;I sat
      and whispered it to myself: &ldquo;Let them take it, yes, let them! I don't care&mdash;it
      will set me free&mdash;I shall have some money! But they're fools to do
      it, they're fools!&rdquo;

     </p>
    <p>
      I linger about it hungrily! He spoke as if he really meant to make them

      they had the manuscript. He would write me.

      I force myself to read these things that half-interest me; but I think I
      spend a quarter of my time wandering about whispering that they are going
      to publish it. I cry out, &ldquo;Oh, they must!&rdquo; I go into the library and stare
      at the magazine and think of it there. I walk past the publishers', and
      think of it there! I have been inquiring all about publishing, about terms
      and all that sort of thing. It makes my brain reel&mdash;why, they might
      pay me five hundred dollars for it! Think of it&mdash;five hundred
      dollars!&mdash;I could go crazy with such a thought as that.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then I think what the reviews will say of it, and I cry, &ldquo;Oh, no, it
      can't be true!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again I find myself saying, &ldquo;Only let them take it! I don't care about the

      I walked past the editor's office to-day. It took just every bit of will
      that I had, not to go in. I said: &ldquo;He might know even now, and I wouldn't
      hear till to-morrow!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But I didn't do it. I said I would wait a week, anyhow.

      I don't know what in the world to make of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The week ended to-day, and nothing yet; and I hit upon another scheme, I
      went to the publishers. I said: &ldquo;I will ask them, and he needn't know
      anything about it and it won't bother him.&rdquo; So I went in and they referred
      me to the manuscript clerk. She said she had never heard of The Captive.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it's here somewhere,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;the editor brought it here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no manuscript ever comes here,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;that is not
      entered on my books.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;some member of the firm must have it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If any member of the firm got it,&rdquo; she said, smiling, &ldquo;the first thing he
      would do would be to bring it to me to enter in the books.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I insisted. I wanted to see somebody in the firm, but she answered me
      there was no use. Finally she suggested that they might know something
      about it up in the offices of the magazine. I went there, but no, no one
      had ever heard of it there.
    </p>
    <p>
      I came home dazed. I don't know what in the world to make of it. He
      certainly said that the firm was reading it. I wrote to-night to ask him
      about it.

      I have waited day by day in the utmost perplexity to hear from him about
      that. I should have heard from him yesterday. I don't know what in the
      world to make of it. Can he have gone in to them privately? Or can he have
      forgotten it&mdash;he is so busy!
    </p>

      I waited four days more. I went up to see him. Just as I feared. I have
      annoyed him. I could see it. I know he must be tired of seeing my face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Stirling,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I have told you that the poem is being read by
      the firm, and that I will let you know the moment I hear from them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I only came,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;because the clerk told me&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are some things clerks don't know,&rdquo; he put in.
    </p>
    <p>
      I tremble at the thought of making him angry. I will not go near him

      I am doing my best to keep my mind on some reading, so as not to make the
      agony unbearable. But it is very hard&mdash;the mails disturb you. I can
      only read in the middle of the day, and at night. In the morning I expect
      the first mail, trembling; but after that I know a city letter can't come
      till afternoon, so I can read. Then again at night I know it can't come.

      It <i>is</i> skippable&mdash;the consequence of having a foolish scheme to

      It has been another week. I could not stand it any more. I am going over
      to the publishers' again this afternoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &mdash;What in Heaven's name does this thing mean? I met the satisfied
      smile of the clerk again. &ldquo;We have never seen the manuscript, Mr.
      Stirling!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      If you could only see how positive she is! &ldquo;I don't know anything about
      what the editor told you, I can only tell you positively that he has never
      submitted any such manuscript to the firm, or to anybody connected with
      the firm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That thing drove me wild. I don't know what to make of it. Surely he's
      given it to some one, for he told me so.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went up to the magazine rooms, and he was in his office; but he had left
      word that he would not see any one, and they would not even take in my
      name.

      I can do nothing but haunt that place till I find out what it means! It
      has been three weeks and a half since he gave it to them, and he said I
      would hear at once. What in the world does he think it means to me? Can't
      I presume the slightest gleam of interest, of care, on his part?

      To-day I could not stand it any longer. I went to the place again. I saw
      the manuscript clerk once more&mdash;the same answer. I went upstairs; he
      was there again, but busy. I wrote a note and left it. I explained that I
      did not in the least wish to trouble him, but that the thing meant a great
      deal to me, and that I had the utmost need of promptness; that it had been
      almost four weeks since he gave it to the firm, and that nobody there
      seemed to know anything about it.

      is the most tormenting thing! Think what it means! And what in Heaven's
      name has he done? Surely some one&mdash;he must have given it to some one!

      No letter yet. I went back to the publishers' again this morning. I have
      been wandering by the place every day since. They had not seen it yet. She
      said she'd have the firm inquire, but I said not to, as it might annoy
      him. &ldquo;He surely has given it to some one, you know.&rdquo;&mdash;She laughed at
      me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went up to the magazine office again. He was not there, but I saw his
      associate. The associate did not know anything about it either.

      to do me for ten weeks, and here are over five of them gone in this
      hideous way. Oh, it is monstrous!
    </p>
    <p>
      It has been nine weeks and a half since I gave him that poem in the
      beginning! I never spent nine such weeks of horror in my life.

      have never seen that manuscript</i>!
    </p>
    <p>
      I was going by there to-day, and I couldn't withstand the temptation; the
      week was not up, but I said: &ldquo;If I inquire, there's no reason why he
      should know about it.&rdquo; I went in.
    </p>
    <p>
      And that terrible clerk&mdash;she smiled at me still! The more I talked,
      the more she shook her head. &ldquo;There's no such manuscript ever been seen
      here,&rdquo; she said. I showed her the letter, and that decided her to go in
      and see the firm. They sent out word that neither they nor their readers
      had ever heard of it, but that they would write to the editor at once.

      Oh, I think this is horrible&mdash;horrible! And then just guess what I
      did! I couldn't bear the agony&mdash;I went to the other place, and he
      wasn't there, and so at last I went to his club.
    </p>
    <p>
      He wasn't at the club, but they told me where he was; and I spent ten
      cents telephoning him. At this place they said he had an engagement to be
      there later, so I spent another ten cents, and that time I found him. I
      told him who I was. &ldquo;The week isn't up yet,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;but the firm say
      they have never received the manuscript.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So?&rdquo; he said; his voice sounded hard, I thought, and it made me shudder.
      &ldquo;You come up to see me the day after to-morrow at ten o'clock, and you'll
      hear about your manuscript.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And that is all. And I walked out of the great, rich club, and I have been
      pacing up and down in my own garret ever since. I am almost too ill with
      anxiety to stand.

      head&mdash;I did not know what I was doing. I was really crazy&mdash;it is

      To-day I went up to see that man as he told me to. I went trembling with
      suspense&mdash;just think, it has been eleven weeks since this agony
      began. And I went into his office&mdash;he was alone; and when he saw me
      he sprang to his feet&mdash;my soul, he looked like a tiger. He stood
      there in the middle of the room fairly gasping with rage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;you've come, have you! I tell you, young man, I have
      never been subjected to such an outrage as this in my life! I would not
      read another manuscript for you&mdash;why, I wouldn't stand for such an
      imposition from Balzac or Thackeray&mdash;no, sir, I wouldn't!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I stared at the man simply speechless with astonishment. &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; I panted,
      &ldquo;what do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do I mean? Why, you have hounded me about this city until I'm crazy.
      There's no place I can go to escape you. You come to my office, you come
      here, you come to my club! You have made yourself a perfect pest at the
      publishers to every one! Why&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stopped out of breath. Of course I have no courage or head with men&mdash;I
      was ready to grovel at his feet. &ldquo;My dear sir,&rdquo; I pleaded, &ldquo;I assure you I
      didn't mean to do anything of the kind&mdash;it was only that the clerk
      kept telling me&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't care what the clerk kept telling you! I tell you that that
      manuscript has been in the hands of the company since the day I told you I
      would leave it there. Of course there have been delays, there is all sorts
      of routine to go through with; but suppose all our contributors did the
      same thing&mdash;what would we do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was talking at me as if expecting a reply. Fortunately the right words
      came to my lips&mdash;I was really ready to cry with shame and perplexity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't think it is quite the same with all your contributors,&rdquo; I said,
      with a trembling voice. &ldquo;While I have been waiting I have been simply
      starving.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It seemed to clear the atmosphere. He stared at me, and then he sat down.
      He was ashamed of himself, I could see. &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you couldn't have
      been paid anything for months.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't know,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I didn't know anything about it. But I have been
      starving.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He spoke more quietly. &ldquo;Mr. Stirling,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I'm very sorry about
      this, the whole thing has been unfortunate. Excuse me that I spoke
      angrily; let us not think any more about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I stood there, feeling almost like crying, I was so nervous.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, about that manuscript,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;I'm doing what I can to learn
      about it. It's been there all along, as I told you, and you will hear
      about it soon. Why, Mr. Stirling, I even took the trouble to send my
      secretary down there yesterday to make sure that it was all right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not want you to go to any such trouble,&rdquo; I stammered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's all right,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;don't mention it. Now they will have decided
      in a few days, and I will write you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, please do not,&rdquo; I said, still with my abject humility. &ldquo;Don't take
      any more trouble&mdash;let me go there and find out&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By no means!&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Take my advice and don't go near there again
      under any circumstances. You can't tell how much an author hurts himself
      by troubling a publisher as you have done. Don't go near there&mdash;let
      me write to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I promised that I would; and then with more abjectness I got myself out of
      that room, and I went out and sat down upon a step near by, simply shaking
      like a leaf.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, heavens!&rdquo; I gasped. &ldquo;That was horrible! Horrible!&rdquo;
     </p>

    </p>
    <p>
      I sat dazed&mdash;thinking about it&mdash;thinking it over and over&mdash;I
      couldn't understand it, try as I might. Why should he have been so angry
      <i>that</i> day&mdash;had he not told me to come there? And had he not
      said I should have a report?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      &mdash;And then suddenly something flashed over me that made me leap! That
      firm had written him a letter the day before yesterday asking about the
      manuscript, and <i>that</i> was why he was angry! And he had sent his
      secretary down to inquire!&mdash;But why in Heaven's name should he send
      his secretary down to inquire <i>when he had a telephone connecting with
      the firm right there in his office</i>!
    </p>
    <p>
      And so I saw it&mdash;all in one instant the thing flashed over me!
    </p>
    <p>
      I was so wild I paid a car-fare&mdash;I rode straight as a die down to
      that place, and I went in and saw the clerk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has sent the manuscript now,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;hasn't he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He sent it in yesterday?&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He sent it by his secretary, didn't he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; I answered, and went out.

      Is not that simply monstrous, simply awful beyond words? I have been
      beside myself tonight with rage, with amazement, with perplexity. Oh,
      think what I have suffered at the hands of that frightful man! And what
      have I <i>done</i> to him&mdash;why should he have treated me so? What
      does it mean? I am baffled every way I turn.
    </p>
    <p>
      The thing is like flame in my blood&mdash;like acid in my veins. It makes
      me hysterical with pain. I cry aloud.

      &mdash;What do you mean by it, you monster, you wretch? Why, here for
      eleven weeks I have been hanging upon your every word&mdash;eleven weeks
      of my life spent in torment&mdash;absolutely flung away! <i>Eleven weeks!</i>
      And you have lied to me&mdash;and you have kicked me about like a dog!
    </p>
    <p>
      What do you mean? What do you mean? Tell me, above all, <i>why</i> you did
      it! Were you torturing me on purpose? Or did you simply forget it? But
      then, how could you forget it when you had to tell me all those miserable
      falsehoods? And when you had to write me those letters?
    </p>
    <p>
      And then to-day!
    </p>
    <p>
      That is the thing that goads me most&mdash;to-day! I stood there cringed
      before you like a beaten cur&mdash;you kicked me&mdash;you spit upon me!
      And it was every bit of it a lie! That insolent rage of yours&mdash;why,
      it wasn't even genuine! You weren't even angry&mdash;you knew that you had
      no reason to be angry&mdash;that you had treated me as if I were a worm to
      tread on! And yet you stood there and abused me!
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh&mdash;why, the thing is madness to think of! It is more madness the
      more you realize it! I have never known anything like it before in my
      life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes&mdash;actually&mdash;it is something quite new to me. I have met blind
      people&mdash;people who would not heed me&mdash;but a really evil person I
      have never known before! A person who has no respect for another's rights&mdash;who
      would trample upon another! Oh, you miserable wretch&mdash;and the lies&mdash;the
      lies! The hateful sneaking of it&mdash;you black-hearted, insolent man!
      The manuscript had been there all the time! <i>The delays, the routine</i>!
      And you had sent your secretary down to inquire! And above all&mdash;oh,
      above all&mdash;the prince of them&mdash;I must not go near there lest I
      should injure myself! I must not go near them&mdash;they were so weary of
      seeing me! And I never saw a single soul there in my life but one clerk!
    </p>
    <p>
      I never suffered such a thing as this before in all my days&mdash;deliberate,
      brutal injustice! And that I should be so placed as to be a victim of such
      a thing&mdash;that I should have to hang upon your words and to be at your
      mercy for eleven weeks of agony! You are a great editor, a clubman, a rich
      man! You have fame and power and wealth&mdash;and you stand up there and
      scald me with your rage&mdash;and with your heart a mess of lies all the

      consternation. Why? <i>Why?</i>&mdash;Were you not interested in my work?
      If you weren't&mdash;why didn't you give it back to me, and let me go my
      way? And if you were&mdash;if you had any idea of publishing it&mdash;then
      why did you use me in this way? Where was the manuscript all this time?
      What did you mean to do with it? How long did you expect me to wait? And
      what object did you have in telling me untruths about it meanwhile?
    </p>
    <p>
      &mdash;The whole thing is as blank to me as night. That a man should have
      in him so much infinite indifference about another as to leave that
      manuscript in a drawer, and write me that I was to &ldquo;have a report on it
      within a week&rdquo;! Why, it is something of which I can not even think. And
      then to get out of it by that sham anger and that sneaking!&mdash;

      I have done absolutely nothing but brood over this thing and rage all day.
      What am I to do?&mdash;I sat and wondered if there was anything I could do
      but go and shoot that man. And I asked myself: Ought I not at least to go
      and get the manuscript from that accursed place this instant? Ought I not
      to have taken it then and there? But see the utter misery of my situation,
      the abject shame of it&mdash;suppose they were to take the thing! It is my
      one hope in this world&mdash;I dare not lose it&mdash;I have to leave it
      there!

    <p>
      But then, what hope is there now? I ask. Why, he was going to urge it upon
      them! And now, of course, he's simply sent it in there without a word!
    </p>
    <p>
      Don't you see what it was&mdash;it was that letter of inquiry they wrote
      him! He paid no more attention to me than if I were a hound; but he had to
      send it when they wrote! And perhaps they said something about
      carelessness and that made him wild.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, the thing is an endless spring of gall to me! I am all raw with it&mdash;I
      have to rush out on the street and walk away my passion. I never saw my
      situation so plainly&mdash;the horrible impotence of it! Just see what I
      struggle against, the utter insane futility of everything I do! Why, I
      beat my wings in a void, I hammer my head against a wall!

      aside!

      But no&mdash;I could not go near the place! I could not face that man

      in value by the delay.

      I was looking at that man's magazine to-day. What thoughts it brought to
      me&mdash;what agonies, what longings, what despair! And, above all, what
      ocean-floods of bitterness!

      I walked all the way down to the wholesale-paper store. I thought I would
      prefer that to evils that I know not of. I have almost a terror of having
      to come into contact with new people.
    </p>
    <p>
      But my place was filled. I trudged home again. I went to the publisher's
      too; nothing yet. The three weeks were up to-day.

      I dared not wait any more to-day. I had just three dollars and ten cents
      left. And my rent is due the day after to-morrow. I have answered every
      sort of advertisement, from dishwashing to tutoring a boy. I guess I
      looked too seedy for the latter.

      &mdash;Sometimes when I am wandering around in all this misery, still

      honor to be helped&mdash;if I could only find him.&rdquo;

      If all the world were poor, it would not be so bad; but the sight of
      wealth&mdash;of infinite oceans of it squandered in perfect frenzies of

      I have tramped the streets for two days more. I was made so ill by my
      anxiety last time that I made up my mind I would not risk it again. I
      asked my landlady to-night to wait a while, as I was looking for some
      work. She was ungracious enough, but I have no longer any sensibilities&mdash;I
      only want to be safe. She can wait&mdash;she has my trunk, as I told her.

      Probably she wouldn't even be as willing, if she could see what is in it!
      I have no longer anything to sell. I had to exchange my waiter's costume
      for a pair of trousers, for mine were all in rags.

      I have two dollars and seventy cents. I imagine that is a safe margin.

    <p>
      There are no words that can tell what an absolutely deadening thing it is
      to be wandering about the city looking for work. It turns you into a log
      of wood&mdash;you not only no longer have an idea, you have not a thought
      of an idea. You simply drag on and on until the thing becomes a habit, and
      you go without even thinking of that.

      So long as I have thoughts I can write a journal; but while my life is
      that of an animal, it doesn't seem very necessary. I have always felt
      myself an outcast&mdash;a poet has to be that; but I never felt it quite
      so much as at present. I wander around from door to door; and those who
      have homes and money and power&mdash;they simply order me out of the way.

      The day before yesterday, when I woke up in the morning, I could hardly
      stand. My head was on fire, and I do not think I have ever been so sick
      before. I got around to a drug-store&mdash;the man said he would give me
      some powders; he said they were forty cents, but I dared not pay it. He
      gave them to me for a quarter. He said I should have a tonic, but I
      haven't had it.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was too ill to move all day yesterday. I am better to-day, but still I
      daren't go out. I have only eighty-five cents left.

      I had a scene with that horrible creature yesterday. It was the second
      week&mdash;she thought I was shamming, I know. She said she never allowed
      her &ldquo;roomers&rdquo; to get behindhand&mdash;it was her invariable rule. O God, I
      was so sick I could scarcely see&mdash;I did not care what she did. I told
      her that I had no money; that I was waiting to get some work; that I would
      pay her the first moment I could.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don't you keep work when you get it?&rdquo; she demanded. &ldquo;You have been
      idle nearly all the whole time you've been here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I could not argue with her; she can turn me out when she likes.

      I thought to-day I would call upon some of my relatives. But I bit my lips

      mine. I took them to the grocery-store where I buy things and asked the

      I got some work to do after all&mdash;at the height of my despair. I am
      giving out samples of a hitherto unequaled brand of soap.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was yesterday morning, I met one of the men and asked him where he got
      the job. He said they wanted more men, so I got on a car and rode down
      there in haste. I made fifty cents yesterday, for half a day, and a dollar
      to-day. Thank God!
    </p>
    <p>
      I spent the night before last in the Park, and last night in the room
      where I am writing. It is in a tenement-house. I paid fifty cents a week
      for it, and there is a drunken man snoring on the other side of a board
      partition.
    </p>
    <p>
      I sha'n't go back to the other place, of course, until I get more money.
      Besides, she has probably rented the room.

    </p>
    <p>
      I am getting used to walking all day; anything so long as one doesn't have
      the agonizing worry about starvation. I am ill, but I shall keep at it,
      and answer advertisements meanwhile by mail, till I get something better.
    </p>

      I am going out to sit by the river. I can not stand the heat and stench in

      THE END
    </h3>
    <p>
      Listen to me now. I must soon get to the end of this. I mean to tell you
      about it. I have spent yesterday and to-day going over this journal,
      explaining things that I had written too briefly, putting in things that
      ought to be there. I mean to tell everything.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I began this journal it was with the idea that I should be famous,
      and that then it would be published. Of late I have written it from habit,
      mainly, never expecting that any one would see it. Now I write again for a
      reader, <i>to</i> a reader. I know that it will be published.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The night before last I went down by the river. As well as I can remember,
      these were the thoughts that came to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a calm, still night, and I sat watching the lights on the water.
      Then suddenly I recollected the night when the yacht had passed, and I had
      heard the woman singing. It came back to me like an apparition, that voice
      and that melody. I heard it again more plainly than words can tell, dying
      away over the water; and a perfect sea of woe rolled over my soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      I thought of that night, what I had been that night, what hopes I had had,
      what fervor, what purpose, what faith. That was, you remember, just when I
      was at the height of my work; and the memory came back to me, as it has
      never come back to me since the day that I came out of the forest with my
      book. It simply overwhelmed me, it shook me to the very depths of my
      being. I buried my face and burst out sobbing. It shook away from me all
      the hideous dulness that had mastered me. I saw myself as I was, ruined,
      lost. I cried out: &ldquo;Oh, my Father in heaven, it is gone! It is gone, and
      it will never come back! I am a lost soul! I am a traitor, I am ruined!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So I went on, feverishly, twisting my hands together. &ldquo;I have given up the
      fight! I have been beaten&mdash;oh, my God&mdash;beaten! Think of those
      raging hours in the woods, those hours of defiance, of glory! I gazed at
      commonplaceness and dulness&mdash;I mocked at it; and now it has conquered
      me! I am trampled down, beaten! It is all gone out of me!&rdquo; And then I
      cried out in despair and terror: &ldquo;Oh, no, it can't be! It <i>can't</i>
      be!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But even while I cried that, my thoughts fled back to the horror to which
      I was tied, to the samples of soap and to the filthy hole next to a
      drunken laborer. The thing overwhelmed me, even while I stood there trying
      to resolve.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was frenzied. &ldquo;I have done everything,&rdquo; I panted, &ldquo;I have fought and
      toiled and struggled&mdash;I have wept and prayed, and even begged. And
      yet I have been beaten&mdash;I have gone down&mdash;down! And what more is
      there that I can do? I shall be beaten down again! Oh, what shall I do? Is
      there any hope, any new plan that I can try? Shall I go through the
      streets and shriek it; shall I lay hold upon some man and <i>make</i> him
      hear me? Is there anything&mdash;<i>anything</i>?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To make them understand what I have! To make them understand what they are
      doing! God gave me a vision&mdash;it may not come again for a century, it
      can never come again&mdash;it is mine&mdash;<i>mine only</i>! And they
      grind it into the dust! This demon power that is in me&mdash;don't you
      suppose I know what it is? This thing that roars like the wind upon the
      mountains, that runs like the great billows on the sea!
    </p>
    <p>
      I was pacing back and forth in the silent night. I had all the world about
      me, I cried out to it, I gripped it, to make it hear me. &ldquo;Fools! oh
      fools!&rdquo; I cried, &ldquo;what is it that you <i>do</i> believe in? Blind
      creatures that you are, this raging faith of mine&mdash;this fervent ardor&mdash;you
      do not believe in <i>that</i>! You do not believe in enthusiasm, you do
      not believe in ecstasy, you do not believe in genius! You think that I am
      mad, poor raving poet! You see me sick, haggard, dragging myself about.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I am caged, I tell you,&mdash;I am caged! You are killing me as you
      would kill some animal; and I am never to sing that song&mdash;I am never
      to sing that song!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The thing was a madness to me. &ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; I rushed on, &ldquo;I will! I will get
      free&mdash;I say I will! If I must, I will go out and beg on the streets,
      before I will let this thing die! Show me the vilest of you&mdash;I will
      get down upon my knees before him&mdash;I will kiss his feet and beg him
      to let me live! There is no degradation of my <i>self</i> that I will not
      bear! I!&mdash;what am I? I am a worm&mdash;I am filth&mdash;I am vanity
      and impertinence and delusion. But <i>this</i> thing&mdash;this is <i>God</i>!
      Oh you man with a carriage, will <i>you</i> not give me a little? For a
      hundred or two of dollars I can live for a year! And you&mdash;why, see
      that ring on your finger! You would not think twice if you lost it; and
      yet think what I could do with that bauble! Oh, see how you abuse life&mdash;how
      you mock it, how you trample upon it&mdash;how you trample upon <i>God</i>!
    </p>
    <p>
      &mdash;&ldquo;So I go about all day, haunted all the time, raging, lusting for
      my task. And you who believe in genius in the past, and do not believe in
      it in the present! Some of you had this faith when you were young; but I
      have it always&mdash;it is <i>I</i>! I was born for that, I will die for
      that! It is my love, my food, my health, my breath, my life! It comes to
      me wherever I am&mdash;carrying trays in a restaurant&mdash;pacing back
      and forth by the river&mdash;sitting here in my room and writing of it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      So I thought, so I cried out; and each time as the thing surged in me, I
      sank down and moaned and sobbed. &ldquo;No, it is all lost. I am helpless. I am
      beaten! I am walled in and tortured! I am a slave, I am a prisoner&mdash;I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &mdash;And so the torrent of my thoughts sped on, and so I rushed with it&mdash;rushed
      to my fate. For suddenly I came to four words&mdash;four fearful words
      that roared in my soul like the thunder!&mdash;
    </p>
    <h3>
      &ldquo;I AM A CAPTIVE!&rdquo;
     </h3>
    <p>
      It was like the falling of a bolt from the sky. It came with a sound that
      stunned me, with a flash that lit in one instant the whole horizon of my
      mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am a captive! I am <i>The</i> Captive! Fool that I am,&mdash;pent here
      in these prison-walls of tyranny, and beating out my brains against them!
      Panting&mdash;praying&mdash;cursing&mdash;pining to be free! And I am The
      Captive!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The thing struck terror into the last chambers of my soul. I stood stock
      still; I felt my flesh quiver, I felt my very hair move. I saw a pair of
      demon eyes glaring into mine&mdash;I saw all the wildness and the
      fearfulness of life in that one instant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wrote a book, I tried to make it true&mdash;and, oh, my God, how have I
      succeeded!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I do not know what I did, I was half-crazed, as in a nightmare. I fought
      and struggled; but I was in the grip of a truth, and though it set my
      brain on fire, I had to face it.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was The Captive! I was The Captive! And I was crying out against
      circumstances&mdash;I was crying out against my fate&mdash;and all the
      time there it stood and faced me&mdash;the truth, the iron truth:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      &mdash;<i>I was to die!</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      A sudden fury swept over me&mdash;my whole being flamed with wrath.
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; I cried. &ldquo;I shall go on in this servitude&mdash;in this
      degradation! I shall go on playing the lackey to the filthy pleasures of
      men, cringing, crouching before any insult&mdash;begging for my bread&mdash;begging
      to keep my miserable self alive! And I shall see one by one my virtues die
      in me, my powers, my consecrations! I shall sink into a beast of burden,
      into a clod of the earth, into a tool of men!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I, who wrote The Captive&mdash;my God, who wrote The Captive! I, who
      stood upon that height, drank in that glory, sang with those angels and
      gods! I, who was noble and high-born&mdash;pure and undefiled&mdash;seer
      and believer&mdash;I! I walked with Truth&mdash;and now I am a slave; a
      whimpering, beaten hound! They have made a eunuch of me, they have cut
      away my manhood! They have put me with their swine, they have fed me upon
      husks, they have bid me drink their swill! And I bear it, by God, I bear
      it! And why?&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>I bear it that I may live!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come here, come here! Look at this!&rdquo; The thing seized me by the shoulders
      and shook me, the thing with the fiery eyes. &ldquo;Did you <i>mean</i> it, all
      that you wrote in that book&mdash;did you mean it, those vows that you
      swore in the forest? Were they the truth of your soul as you faced your
      God&mdash;or were they shams that you dallied with to please your vanity?
      Answer me! <i>Answer</i>!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      I sank down upon the ground as I heard that voice. I was shuddering with
      fear; and I moaned aloud: &ldquo;I don't want to die! I want to live, I want to
      do my work!&rdquo;&mdash;And then I heard the voice say, &ldquo;You hound!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And so I shut my hands like a vise; and I panted: &ldquo;No, no! Come! Take me!
      I will go!&rdquo; I think it must have been hours that I lay there, wrestling in
      horrible agony. I cried again and again: &ldquo;Yes, yes,&mdash;I will do it! I
      will do it!&rdquo; I fled on breathlessly, whispering, panting to myself. Before
      I knew it I was saying part of The Captive&mdash;the first fearful lines
      of the struggle:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Spirit or fiend that led me to this way!
</pre>
    <p>
      Oh, tell me, was ever poet so taken at his word before?
    </p>
    <p>
      I thought of that then, and I shook like a leaf with the pain of it. Again
      and again I faced it, again and again I failed. It was physical pain, it
      was a thing that I could feel like a clutch at my heart. Was it not
      tearing out my very soul?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      But the voice cried out to me: &ldquo;You have been a slave to the world! You
      have been a slave to life! You have been crucified upon the cross of Art!&rdquo;&mdash;Yes,
      and all things a man may sacrifice to Art but one thing; he may not
      sacrifice his soul!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; it rushed on. &ldquo;Have you so much faith in your art, and no faith in
      your God? Is it for <i>Him</i> that you have so much need to fear, to
      crouch and tremble, to plot and to plan&mdash;for <i>Him</i>? And when he
      made you, when he gave you your inspiration&mdash;his soul was faint?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He that sendeth forth the surging springtime, and covereth all the earth
      with new life! He that is the storm upon the sea, the wind upon the
      mountains, the sun upon the meadows! He that poureth the races from his
      lap! He that made the ages, the suns and the systems throughout all space&mdash;he
      that maketh them forever and smiteth them into dust again for play! He
      that is infinite, unthinkable, all-glorious, all-sufficient&mdash;<i>He
      hath need of thee</i>!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He hath need that thy wonderful books should be written, that mankind
      should hear thy wonderful songs! Thy books, thy songs, that are to last
      through the ages! And when this earth shall have withered, when the sun
      shall have touched it with his fiery finger, when it shall roll through
      space as silent and bare as the desert, when the comet shall have smitten
      it and hurled it into dust, when the systems to which it belongs&mdash;the
      sun into which it melted&mdash;shall be no more known to time&mdash;<i>where
      then will be thy books and thy songs</i>? Where then will be these things
      for which thou didst crouch and tremble, didst plot and plan? For which
      thou didst lick the feet of vile men&mdash;<i>for which thou didst give up
      thy God</i>!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And then I leaped up and stretched out my arms. &ldquo;No! No!&rdquo; I cried aloud:
      &ldquo;I have done with it! Have I not fought this fight once, and did I not win
      it&mdash;this fight of The Captive? And can I not fight it and win it
      again? Away, away with you, world, for I am a free man again, and no
      slave! Soul am I, <i>will</i> am I, unconquerable, all-defying! In His
      arms I lie, in His breath I breathe, in His life I live&mdash;I am <i>He</i>!
      Fear I know not, death I know not, slavery and sin and doubt and fear I
      will never know again!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nay,&mdash;nay. Go thy road, proud world, and I go mine!&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  In dem wogenden Schwall,
  in dem tönenden Schall,
  in des Welt-Athems
    wehendem All!&mdash;
    ertrinken&mdash;
    versinken&mdash;
    unbewusst&mdash;
    höchste Lust!
</pre>
    <p>
      Oh, think not of that poetry! Think of the music! The surging, drunken,
      overwhelming waves of music! Do you not hear them&mdash;do you not hear
      them?&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Wie sie schwellen,

</pre>
    <p>
      So the thing went; and I panted and throbbed, and sank down upon the
      ground for weakness. There came to me all that mad poetry that I had
      written myself, all that victory that I had won, that freedom, that
      vision, that glory! It came to me ten times over, for was it not
      everything to me now? It was more than I could bear, it split my brain.
    </p>
    <p>
      And it would not leave me. All through the long, long night I prayed and
      wept with it; and in the morning I reeled through the street with it, and
      men stared at me.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      But here was one time when I did not fear men! I was free&mdash;I was a
      soul at last. I had won the victory, I went my way as a god. I had
      renounced, I had given up fear, I had given up my <i>self</i>. My mind was
      made up, and I never change my mind. I had passed the death-sentence upon
      myself, I walked through the streets as a disembodied soul&mdash;as the
      Captive dragged to the banquet-hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      But no, I went to my torture of myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      I went to the store. It was early Sunday morning, and the place was just
      open.&mdash;I got my papers and put them under my arm&mdash;my original
      draft of The Captive, and all my journal. I went down the street and came
      to a place where a man was burning some trash.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was a demon in my strength just then; my head reeled, but I went with
      the dancing step of new-born things. I stood upon the heights, I &ldquo;laughed
      at all Sorrow-play and Sorrow-reality&rdquo;! &ldquo;Ho, sir,&rdquo; I cried, &ldquo;I have things
      here that will make a fire for you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And so I knelt down and unwrapped The Captive. &ldquo;There is much fire in
      this,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;once I thought it would explode, I did. It was a shot that
      would have been heard around the world, sir! Only I could not pull the
      trigger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man stared at me, and so I burned it, page by page, and laughed, and
      sang a foolish song that I thought of: <i>Stride la vampa!</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      And afterward I unwrapped the journal. I laughed at my journal&mdash;'tis
      a foolish thing; but then all at once my conscience touched me. I said:
      &ldquo;Is it not a shame? Is it not small of you? They would not heed you!&mdash;fool,
      what of it? Perhaps it is not their fault&mdash;certainly it is their
      sorrow. But you will not get much higher than you are now by trampling
      upon them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And so I stopped; and I wrapped up my journal again. &ldquo;You have fire enough
      now, sir,&rdquo; I said to the man. &ldquo;I will keep this to build another fire
      with.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I went on. &ldquo;Let them have it,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;let them make what they can out of
      it.&rdquo; And then I laughed aloud: &ldquo;And they will discuss it! And there will
      be reviews of it! And wise articles about it! And learned scholars will
      write tomes upon it, showing how many sentences there are in it ending
      with a punctuation mark; and old ladies and Methodist ministers will shake
      their heads over it and say: 'See what comes of not believing in Adam!'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I walked on, singing the Ride of the Valkyries, the children staring at
      me, going to Sunday-school.
    </p>

    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      But I was glad that there was another copy of The Captive left. I love
      even that wicked editor now.

    <p>

    <p>
      &mdash;All that was a day and a half ago. I am not so happy now, but I am
      very calm. I have found my righteousness again, and I can take whatever
      comes.

      June 3d.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have now three days more to wait, to learn if The Captive is accepted. I
      have money enough to last me till then. If it is not accepted I should
      obviously have to starve, should I not? For I will never serve the world
      again. And am I a sheep that must be driven? No, I shall find a quicker
      way of dying than by starvation. In the meanwhile I live my life and say
      my prayer.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      I have thought a great deal about the thing, and it seems by no means best
      for the world that it should treat all the men who have my gift as it has
      treated me. Let the world take notice that I perish because I have not
      cheap qualities. Because I was born to sing and to worship! Because I have
      no alloy, because I will not compromise, because I do not understand the
      world, and do not serve its uses! If I only knew all the book-gossip of
      the hour, and all the platitudes of the reviews! If only I knew anything
      of all the infinite frivolity and puerility that occupies the minds of
      men! But I do not, and so I am an outcast, and must work as a day laborer
      for my bread.
    </p>
    <p>
      &mdash;The infinite irrationality of it seems to me notable. Why, upon the
      men of genius of the <i>past</i> you feed your lives, you blind and
      foolish men! They are the bread and meat of your souls&mdash;they make
      your civilizations&mdash;they mold your thoughts&mdash;they put into you
      all that little life which you have. And your reviews have use enough for
      <i>them</i>! Your publishers publish enough of <i>them</i>! <i>But what
      thoughts have you about the NEW teacher, the NEW inspirer?</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      The madness of the thing! I read books enough, it seems to me, telling of
      the sufferings of the poets of a century ago!&mdash;of the indifference of
      the critics, the blindness of the public, of a century ago. And those
      things pain you all so cruelly! But the possibility of their happening to
      the poets of the <i>present</i>&mdash;it never seems to enter into your
      heads! Why, that very man who sent me back his curt refusal by his
      secretary&mdash;he writes about the agonies of Shelley and Keats in a way
      that brings the tears into your eyes! And that is only one example among
      thousands.
    </p>
    <p>
      What do these men think? Is it their idea that the public and the critics
      are now so true and so eager that the poets have nothing more to fear?
      That stupidity and blindness and indifference are quite entirely gone out
      of the world? That aspiration and fervor are now so much the rule that the
      least penny-a-liner can judge the new poet?
    </p>
    <p>
      And they think that the soul is dead then! And that God has stopped
      sending into this world new messages and new faiths!
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh you civilization! You society! You critics and lovers of books! Why,
      that new message and that new faith ought to be the one thing in all this
      world that you bend your faculties to save! It is that upon which all your
      life is built&mdash;it is that by which this Republic, for one thing, is
      to be made a factor in the history of mankind. But what do you do? What <i>have</i>
      you done? Here I am; and come now and tell me what it is that you <i>think</i>
      you have done. <i>For I have the message!&mdash;I have the faith</i>! And
      you have starved me, and you have beaten me, until I am too ill to drag
      myself about!
    </p>
    <p>
      And what can I do? Where can I turn? What hope have I, except, as Swift's
      phrase has it, to &ldquo;die like a poisoned rat in a hole&rdquo;? I could wish that
      you would think over that phrase a little while, cultivated ladies and
      gentlemen. It is not pleasant&mdash;to die like a poisoned rat in a hole.
    </p>

    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      You ask me to believe in your civilization; you ask me to believe in your
      love of light! Let me tell you when I would believe in your civilization
      and your love of light.
    </p>
    <p>
      I say that the last and the highest thing in this world is <i>Genius</i>.
      I say that Religion and Art and Progress and Enlightenment&mdash;that all
      these things are made out of Genius; and that Genius is first and last,
      highest, and best, and fundamental. And I say that when you recognize that
      fact&mdash;when you believe in Genius&mdash;when you prepare the way for
      it and make smooth the paths for it&mdash;I say that then and then alone
      may you tell me that you are civilized.
    </p>
    <p>
      The thing shrieks against heaven&mdash;your cruelty, your stupidity. Since
      ever the first poet came into this world it has been the same story of
      agony, indignity, and shame. <i>And what do you do?</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      It is poverty that I talk about, poverty alone! The poet wants nothing in
      this world but to be let alone to listen to the voices of his soul. He
      wants nothing from you in all this world but that you give him food while
      he does it&mdash;while he does it, miserable people&mdash;not for himself,
      but for <i>you</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is the shame upon you&mdash;that you expect&mdash;that you always
      have expected&mdash;that the poet, besides doing the fearful task his
      inspiration lays upon him&mdash;that he shall go out into the coarse,
      ruthless world and slave for his bread! That is the shame! That is the
      indignity, that is the brutality, the stupidity, the infamy! Shame upon
      you, shame upon you, world!

      choking and heart breaking. He comes with tenderness and with trust, with
      joy in the beauty that he beholds. He comes a minstrel, with a harp in his
      hand&mdash;and you set your dogs upon him&mdash;you drive him torn and

      drunkards&mdash;and your poets! Every man must earn for himself, every man
      must pay his way! No man must ask favors, no man must be helped, no man
      shall be any different from other men! For shame! For shame!

      I tell you the agony of this thing is in me yet&mdash;it has heaped itself

      cried out! And now that I can not save my own self&mdash;oh, let me at
      least save the others! O God, let me not die till I have said one word
      that reaches their hearts, till I have done something to change this
      ghastly thing! The voices of the ages cry out to me. Not only the hundreds
      who have gone before&mdash;but the hundreds and the thousands who are to
      come! What are <i>we</i> to do? they cry&mdash;who shall save <i>us</i>?
      Are we to share the same fate&mdash;are we too to struggle and die in
      vain? And in this world that is civilized! In this world that seeks
      progress! In this world that wants nothing but light! Not to the mob I
      speak, not to those who once mocked me; if none but they lived, I should
      hold my tongue and go. But you men who are leaders, you men who stand upon
      the top, you men who see!&mdash;can I not find some word to reach <i>you</i>?
      You men who really love books&mdash;who have money&mdash;who want nothing

      mankind, it will never be anything but the torture-house that I have found
      it, until it makes some provision for its men of <i>Genius</i>! Until this
      simple fundamental thing be true&mdash;that a man may know that if he have
      <i>Genius</i>&mdash;that the day he shows he has <i>Genius</i>&mdash;he
      will be honored and protected by society and not trampled and kicked like
      a dog. That he will not have to go out into the market-place and vend his
      wares! That he will not have to make sick his soul haggling for his bread!
      That if he turns his strength to higher things, and exposes himself to the
      world thereby, he will not be trodden down in the struggle for existence!
      That he will not have to bear indignities and insults; that he will not
      have to write till he be ripe, or be stunted and deformed by early
      deprivation.

    <p>
      Genius. And am I not to die now?&mdash;And what matters the world?
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore let me write it: that I was a man of Genius. And that you have
      trodden me down in the struggle for existence. That I saw things that no
      other man has ever seen, I would have written things that no other man can
      ever write. And that you have trodden me down in the struggle for
      existence&mdash;that you have trodden me down because I could not earn my
      bread!
    </p>

    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      This is what I tell you&mdash;this is what I cry out to you, that the man
      of Genius <i>can not</i> earn his bread! That the work by which he
      develops his power is something absolutely and utterly different from the
      work by which he earns his bread! And that every hour which he gives to
      the one, he lessens his power and his capacity for the other! Every hour
      that he gives to the earning of his bread, he takes from his soul, he
      weakens his work, he destroys beauty which never again can he know or
      dream!
    </p>
    <p>
      And this again is what I tell you, this again is what I cry out to you:
      that the power by which a man of Genius does his work, and the power by
      which he earns his bread, are things so entirely distinct that <i>they may
      not occur together at all</i>! The man may have both, but then again he
      may only have the former.&mdash;And in that case he will die like a
      poisoned rat in a hole.
    </p>

    </p>
    <p>
      What is the first principle of the democracy of which we boast, if it be
      not that excellence, that power, that <i>Genius</i>, is not the attribute
      of the rich or the noble, but that it may make its appearance anywhere
      among men? And you who sigh for men of talent to raise American letters&mdash;what
      do you <i>do</i> about it? I will tell you something right now, to begin
      with; it will startle you, perhaps, and you may not believe it; but I mean
      to prove it later on. For the present I say this: that of the seven poets
      who constitute the glory of the literature of England in the nineteenth
      century, four of them were rich men, five of them were independent, one of
      them was endowed when he was a youth, and the seventh, the greatest of
      them all, died like a poisoned rat in a hole.
    </p>
    <p>
      And what do you <i>do</i> about it? What you do is to lean back in your
      chair and say: &ldquo;The literary market was never so wide-awake as it is now,
      and the publishers never so anxious for new talent&rdquo;!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Fools! And you think that the publishers are in business for the
      developing of talent, and for the glory of literature! And that they care
      about whether a man of Genius dies in the streets, or not! Why, have I not
      heard them tell me, with their own lips, that &ldquo;a publisher who published
      books that the trade did not want would be driven out of business in a
      year&rdquo;?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      And you tell me that the author is an independent man nowadays! And can
      earn his living with his books!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      It is your privilege to think that, if you choose; but perhaps you will
      not mind hearing what <i>I</i> tell you&mdash;that the author can find no
      way to a living more degrading to him than the earning of it with his
      books. I have shoveled snow, and shoveled manure too, in the streets, and
      shoveled food for swine in a restaurant. But I never did anything so
      degrading as I should have had to do if I had tried to earn my living with
      my books.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, the author may be independent, may he! And you will escape with that
      fine platitude, and with that bitter mockery! And never think that the
      author's independence is but the fine phrase for your own indifference!
    </p>
    <p>
      Again it is your privilege to think what you choose; but again perhaps you
      will not mind hearing what I tell you&mdash;that there can never be any
      man in this world more dependent than an author, if he be a true author. A
      true author is the singer and dreamer of society; and who is there more
      dependent than the singer and the dreamer&mdash;who is there less powerful
      and less cunning in the things of the body?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Why, the author gives up his whole life for your joy and help, he
      consecrates himself, he lashes and burns and tortures himself&mdash;for
      your sake! And you spurn him from you, and tell him he is &ldquo;independent&rdquo;!
    </p>
    <p>
      Here is the truth, here is the crux, here is the whole thing in a
      sentence. A publisher is not in business for the furtherance of Art, or
      for the uplifting of humanity, or for the worship of God. He doesn't mind
      doing these things incidentally, of course, when the fortunate occasion
      arises; but do you think if he had his choice between publishing a new
      Paradise Lost to be read fifty years from date, and publishing a biography
      of a reigning prince, or a treatise on gastronomy, or a new dime novel by
      Marie Corelli in a first edition of a hundred thousand copies&mdash;do you
      think he would hesitate, now really?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      You say that &ldquo;literary excellence is identical with publishing
      availability&rdquo;! I tell you that they are as far apart&mdash;why, that they
      are just exactly this far apart&mdash;as far as what mankind likes is from
      what mankind ought to like.

    </p>
    <p>
      And you ask the man of Genius to cringe and tremble before the standard of
      what the reading public likes! You ask him to tame the frenzy of his
      inspiration, to pull your pleasure-carriages with his wingèd steed! He
      shall be no more the seer and the prophet and the leader&mdash;he shall be
      mountebank and public-entertainer.
    </p>
    <p>
      And you call yourself civilized! O God!
    </p>
    <p>
      And the poet! Again the poet! Is he not <i>vital</i> to your society? Is
      he not, in the last analysis, the lawmaker, the law-enforcer&mdash;this
      seeker, this inspirer, this man with the new vision of right? I look at
      this society&mdash;body enough I see, bone and muscle, and a good, large,
      capable stomach. Brain enough I see, too, or nearly enough; but Soul?
      Soul? Who will dare to tell me that there is Soul enough? And your poet&mdash;why,
      <i>he</i> is your Soul! He is the man who fills the millions with the
      breath of life, who makes the whole vast machine a living, rejoicing,
      beautiful thing. <i>He</i>&mdash;every noble impulse that you have has
      come originally from him&mdash;the memory of his words thrill in the
      hearts of men&mdash;pupils gather to study them&mdash;tired hearts seek
      them for refreshment&mdash;they grow and they fill all the earth&mdash;and
      never through the centuries do they die! They blossom into noble impulses,
      into new movements,&mdash;into reforms that reach down to the lowest
      wretches of the gutter, who never even heard of a poet. Why, they have
      reached to the very dogs, that are beaten less than they were.

      And what is it that makes civilization in the end? What is it that the
      world really honors in the end? You Americans, you who love your country,
      you who believe in your country's institutions, who believe that your
      country holds in her womb the future of mankind! You who want the world to
      believe that!&mdash;how are you going to <i>get</i> the world to believe
      that? Is it&mdash;poor, impotent, foolish creatures&mdash;by covering your
      land until it is a maze of twenty-story office buildings? By lining it
      with railroads six feet apart?&mdash;Do you not know that this very hour
      the reason why Europe does not believe in America is that it has not a man
      to sing its Soul? That it has been a century in the eyes of the world, and
      has not yet brought forth one single poet or thinker of the first rank?

      only a boy&mdash;and thrilling with unutterable things! And I am going
      down, down to destruction! Why, for what I had to say I needed years and

      those things would have been?

      serve them, to make smooth their paths and save their every instant for
      them! But your poet, your man of genius&mdash;who makes smooth <i>his</i>
      paths, who helps <i>him</i>? He needs nobody to run and serve him&mdash;he
      needs no cars and no palaces, no gold and precious raiment&mdash;no, nor
      even praise and honor! What he needs&mdash;I have said it once&mdash;he
      needs but to be left alone, to listen to the voices of his soul, and to
      have some one bring him food to keep him alive while he does it. That&mdash;only
      that!&mdash;think of it&mdash;for the most precious things of this life,

      You will provide it that your young poet, your young worshiper, come
      elsewhere to receive a judgment than to the money-making publisher, and to
      the staring, vulgar crowd. You will provide it that he does not measure
      his voice against the big-drum thumping of the best-selling pomposities of
      the hour. You will provide it that he come, with all honor and all
      dignity, to the best and truest men that you can engage for the service;
      and that he come to be judged by one standard, and that not the standard
      of sales. Whether it be true, whether it be noble, whether it be sincere;
      whether it show imagination, whether it have melody, beauty, love,
      aspiration, knowledge; whether, in short, in those forms or in any other
      forms, it have <i>power</i>! Whether the man who wrote it is a man worth
      training, whether he will repay society for its trust, whether he will
      bring new beauty into the world!&mdash;And then, if these things be true,

      Yes, you never thought of that before! I read everything&mdash;everywhere&mdash;and

      the richest nation in the world? Have we not railroads and houses, food
      and clothing and bank-stocks enough to make the brain reel? And do we not
      call ourselves a Christian land? And worship as divine the Teacher who
      said that &ldquo;man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that

      And what would it do? What would it mean? I will tell you a few things
      that it would mean.
    </p>
    <p>
      First of all it would mean that the man who felt in him the voice of God
      would know that there was a road he could travel, would know that there
      was a home for him. He would no longer face the fearful alternative of
      mediocrity or starvation. He would no longer be tempted, he would no
      longer be forced to turn from his faith, and stunt his development, and
      wreck his plans, by base attempts to compromise between his highest and
      what the world will pay for. Can you have any idea what that would mean to
      an artist? You say that you love art! Can you have any idea of the effect
      which that would have upon art? Upon the art of your country&mdash;upon
      American literature! To have a band of perhaps a hundred&mdash;perhaps a
      thousand, proved and chosen&mdash;the best and strongest that could be
      found&mdash;and set free and consecrated to the search for beauty! Try it
      for fifty years&mdash;try it for ten years&mdash;try the method of raising
      your poets in your gardens instead of flinging them into your weed-beds&mdash;and
      see what the result would be! See if in fifty years American literature
      would not have done more than all the rest of the world!

      unused to the world, knowing how to feel and knowing that alone! Is not

      through all the ages, and it will be so through all the ages to come,
      until society has a conscience and a soul. Tell me if there is anything in
      this world more frightful than the lot of the poets who have been born
      poor&mdash;of Marlowe and Chatterton and Goldsmith, Johnson and Burns and
      Keats! And who can tell how many were choked before even their first

      I can not talk of that, for it makes me sick; but I will talk of the poets
      who were born rich. Is it not singular&mdash;is it not terrible&mdash;how
      many of the great stalwart ones were rich? To be educated, to own books,
      to hear music, to dwell in the country, to be free from men and men's
      judgments! Oh, the words break my heart!

      not Hugo rich? And Milton? When he left college he spent five years at his
      father's country place and wrote four poems that have done more to make
      men happy than if they had cost many millions of dollars.

      But let me come to what I spoke of before, the seven poets of this century
      in England.

    <p>
      I name Wordsworth and Byron, Tennyson, Browning and Swinburne, Shelley and
      Keats. I said that six of them were independent, and that the other&mdash;the
      greatest&mdash;died like a dog.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Wordsworth came first; he was young and poor and struggling, and a friend
      left him just such an independence as I have cried for; and he consecrated
      himself to art, and he revolutionized English poetry, he breathed truth
      into a whole nation again. And when he was clear and looked back, he made
      such statements as these: that &ldquo;a poet has to <i>create</i> the taste by
      which he is to be enjoyed,&rdquo; and that &ldquo;my poetry has never brought me
      enough to pay for my shoe-strings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      And see how the publishers and critics&mdash;how the literary world&mdash;received
      him! How they jeered and jibed, and took fifty years to understand him! Oh
      think of these things, think what they mean, you who love literature!
      Think that the world owes its possession of Wordsworth's poetry to the
      accident that a friend died and left him some money!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      I name Byron; he was a rich man. I name Tennyson; he had a little
      competence, and he gave up the idea of marriage and for ten years devoted
      himself to art; and when he was thirty-two he published his work&mdash;and
      then they gave him a pension!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      I name Browning; Browning went his own way, heeding no man; and he never
      had to think about money. I name Swinburne; and the same was true of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      I name Shelley; and Shelley was wealthy. They kept him poor for a time,
      but his poems do not date from then. When he wrote the poetry that has
      been the spiritual food of the high souls of this century, he lived in a
      beautiful villa in Italy, and wandered about the forest with his books.
      And oh, you who love books, stop just a moment and listen: I am dying, and
      the cry of all my soul is in this. Tell me, you who love Shelley&mdash;the
      &ldquo;pardlike spirit, beautiful and swift&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;thyself the wild west wind,
      oh boy divine!&rdquo;&mdash;tell me how much you think you'd have had of that
      glorious burst of music&mdash;that golden rain of melody, of heavenly
      ecstasy&mdash;if the man who wrote had been a wholesale-paper clerk or a
      cable-car conductor! How much do you think you'd have had if when he'd
      torn himself free to write Queen Mab&mdash;or even if he'd been ripe
      enough and written his Prometheus&mdash;if he'd had to take them to
      publishers! If he had had to take them to the critics and the literary
      world and say, &ldquo;Here is my work, now set me free that I may help mankind!&rdquo;

      responsible&mdash;every single man who has money, who loves letters, and
      who faces these facts&mdash;<i>you</i>&mdash;YOU&mdash;are responsible!

      Perhaps you are weary of my pleading, you think that I perish of my own
      weakness. But come and tell me, if you can, what it is that I have not
      done? What expedient is there that I have not tried, what resource, what
      hope? Have I not been true enough, have I not worked enough? Have I been
      extravagant, have I been dissipated? Did I not make my work my best? Come
      and reason with me&mdash;I shall be dead when you read this, but let us
      talk it over calmly. Put yourself here in my place and tell me what you
      would do. Have I not tried the publishers, the critics, the editors, the
      poets, the clergymen, the professors? Have I not waited&mdash;until I am
      sick, crazy? Have I not borne indignities enough? Have I not gotten myself
      kicked enough for my efforts?

    <p>
      &mdash;But you say: &ldquo;I know nothing about The Captive!&rdquo; Yes&mdash;so it is&mdash;then
      let us go back to Shelley. A fair test would be Queen Mab or The Revolt of
      Islam&mdash;he was my age then; but I will go ten years later and take
      Prometheus Bound. Would he have found any one to publish it? <i>Did</i> he
      find any one to <i>read</i> it? Why, ten or twenty years after Shelley
      died, Browning (then a boy) records that he searched all England for a
      copy of that queer poet's works! Why, Shelley's poetry was a byword and a
      mockery; and Shelley himself&mdash;first of all he was insane, of course,
      and afterward he was exile, atheist, adulterer, and scoundrel. They took
      his children away from him, because he was not fit to take care of them!

      And he would not have been welcomed with open arms, I think! And he
      wouldn't have been set free&mdash;consecrated soul that he was. And
      sensitive, nervous, fragile, hysterical boy&mdash;do you think he would
      ever have written his poems, that he would ever have uttered his message?
    </p>
    <p>
      I have to make somebody understand this thing, somehow. I suggest that you
      think what that would have meant to you&mdash;to you who love poetry.
      Think that you would never have read:
    </p>

    <p>
      I repeat that I have to make somebody understand this thing. I try that
      plan a little more. Listen to me now&mdash;think what it would have meant
      if that wise friend had not died when he did; think that you would never
      have read:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  And then my heart with rapture fills,
  And dances with the daffodils!

    <p>
      Think that you would never have read:

<pre xml:space="preserve">
  The light that never was on sea or land,
  The consecration and the poet's dream!
</pre>
    <p>
      Think that you would never have read:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Blank misgivings of a creature
    Moving about in world not realized;
  High instincts before which our moral nature
    Did tremble like a guilty thing surprised!
</pre>
    <p>
      That you would never have read:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Will no one tell me what she sings?
    Perhaps the plaintive numbers flow
  For old, unhappy, far-off things
    And battles long ago.

      I say a third time that I have to make somebody understand this thing. Let
      us try it again now, just once again. Let us suppose that there had not
      been any little independence or any pension. Who can think what it would
      have meant to us? Who can think what it would mean never to have read

      I have often read of murder cases. They tie a rope around the body and a
      stone to the rope; but the stone slips out, or the rope wears, and then it
      is unpleasant. I used to say they were fools; why did they not get a
      dumb-bell or something like that, and a small chain. Then there would have
      been no trouble.

      does not come as a stranger to me now. I take it simply and naturally&mdash;it
      is the end. It is the end that comes to all things in this phantom-dance
      of being; to flowers and to music, to mountains and to planets, to
      histories, and to universes, and to men.

      June 5th.
    </p>
    <p>
      To-day I wished that it were winter. A wonderful idea came to me&mdash;I
      am almost tempted to live and wait for winter. I said: I would choose one
      place where the money-blind and the folly-mad assemble&mdash;where I have
      seen them and had my eyes burned by the sight. I would go to the
      opera-house on the opening night! I would go to the top gallery, and I
      would put my journal, my story, under my coat; and in the midst of the
      thing I would give one cry, to startle them; and I would dash down that
      long flight of steps, and shoot over the railing headfirst.
    </p>
    <p>
      &mdash;Ha! That would make them think! They might read the book, then.
    </p>
    <p>
      What place could be more fitted? In an opera-house meet, as nowhere else
      in this world that I know of, the two extremes of life&mdash;God and the
      devil. I mean on a Wagner night! Here is the inspiration of a sainted
      poet, here is ecstasy unthinkable, flung wide and glorious as the dawn;
      and here is all the sodden and brutal vulgarity of wealth, deaf, blind,
      and strutting in its insolent pomposity.
    </p>
    <p>

    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      &mdash;I am very ill to-day&mdash;I have a splitting headache and I am
      weak. It is from trying to save too much money for the dumb-bell, I fear.
      But I laugh&mdash;what care I? My body is going to wreck&mdash;but what
      care I? Ah, it is a fine thing to be death-devoted, and freed from all the
      ills that flesh is heir to! I go my way&mdash;do what I please&mdash;hammer
      on and on, and let happen what will. What, old head!&mdash;wilt ache? I
      guess I can stop thy aching before long! And all ye mechanical
      miscellaneities&mdash;stomachs and what not! <i>Thou</i> wilt trouble me
      too? Do thy pleasure, go thy way&mdash;I go mine!

    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      There is a kind of intoxication in it. I climb upon all these ills that
      used to frighten me&mdash;I mock at them, I am a god. I smite my head&mdash;I
      say, &ldquo;I am done with thee, old head! I have thought with thee all the
      thoughts I have to think!&rdquo;

    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      I have made me right drunk upon life, yes, that is the truth; and now the
      feast is over, and I will smash the crockery! Come, boys, come!&mdash;Away
      with it! Through the window here with the head&mdash;look out of the way
      below there for the stomach&mdash;ha, ha!
    </p>
    <p>
      &mdash;Is not that Shakespearian humor for you? Such a thing it is to be
      death-devoted!

      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      &mdash;But there is a deeper side to this wonderful thing&mdash;this
      prospect of peace&mdash;this end of pain. All these solemn realities that
      were so much to thee&mdash;this &ldquo;world&rdquo; and all its ways&mdash;its
      conventions and proprieties, its duties and its trials; how now, do they
      seem so much to thee after all? Cynical relative that wouldst &ldquo;leave it to
      time&rdquo;&mdash;was I so wrong, that I would not hear thy wisdom? Suppose thou
      wert coming with me to-morrow&mdash;hey? And to leave all thy clothes and
      thy clubs, thy bank-account, and thy reputation, and thy stories! Ah, thou
      canst not come with me, but thou wilt come after me some day, never fear.
      This is a journey that each man goes alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, it is easy to be a man when you are sentenced to die. Then all things
      slip into their places, power and pride, wealth and fame&mdash;what
      strange fantasies they seem! What tales I could tell the world at this
      minute, of how their ways seem to me!&mdash;Oh, take my advice, good
      friend, and pray thy God for one hour in which thou mayst see the truth of
      all those foolish great things of thy life!

      I read Alastor this afternoon. What a strange vision it is! And I, too, in
      awe and mystery shall journey away unto a high mountain to die.

    <p>
      &mdash;And then later I went out into the Park. I saw a flower; and
      suddenly the wild ecstasy flashed over me, and I sank down upon a seat,
      and hid my face in my hands, and everything swirled black about me. I
      cried: &ldquo;I do not want to die! Why, I am only a boy! I love the flowers&mdash;I
      want to see the springtime!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And then I felt some one take me by the shoulder, and heard a grim voice
      within me say, &ldquo;Come! Come!&rdquo;
     </p>

      Oh, it will be all right, never fear! Never yet have I failed to do what I
      resolved to do. And thou world, thou wouldst have me thy slave; but I am
      no man's slave&mdash;not I!

      June 6th.
    </p>
    <p>
      Last night I knelt by the bedside, far into the deep hours, far into the
      dawn. The whole drama of my life rolled out before me, I saw it all, I
      lived it all again; and Him in whose arms I lay&mdash;I blessed Him for
      the whole of it. Now that the pain is gone I see that it was beautiful,
      that flower of my life. Other flowers the plant might have borne; but this
      flower was beautiful; and each flower is for itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      I stretch out my arms, I float upon a tide, back, back, into the rolling
      source of things. Weep not for me, you who may love me; I can not die, for
      I never was; that which I am, I was always, and shall be ever; I am <i>He</i>.
      Go out into the world, you who may love me, and say, &ldquo;This flower is he,
      this sunset cloud is he; this wind is his breath, this song is his
      spirit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      What is my faith, the faith in which I die? It is the faith of modern
      thought; it is the faith of the ages. It is a spiritual Pantheism, an
      impassioned Agnosticism.

    <p>

    <p>
      A Presence am I; what is my source I know not, nor can I ever know. The
      moral fact I know, my will; and I take it as I find it, and rejoice in the
      making of beauty.
    </p>

      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Do I believe that I ever shall live again? I know that I shall not. I do
      not insult His perfection and my faith, with the wish that such as I
      should be immortal. What I have He gave me; it is His, and He will take
      it. I have no rights, and I have no claims. I see not why He should give
      me ages because He has given me an hour. He never turns back, He never
      makes over again&mdash;that I know.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      &mdash;And neither do I ask rewards; my life was beautiful, I bless Him
      for every prayer. I ask Him not that He cover the fair painting with
      whitewash.

      will fling off the world, I will fling off pain, I will fling off health.
      I will say, &ldquo;Burst thyself, brain! Rend thyself, body, as thou wilt!&mdash;but

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
